Oven roasting isn't particularly difficult, but I always, always, always forget the procedure for different veg and legumes. So here we are.

=== "General Directions"
    1. **Preheat oven** to 450°F (232°C). Dress sheet pan with aluminum foil.
    2. **Prepare**. See "specifics".
    3. **Add cooking fat**. In order of preference: Lard, ghee, extra virgin olive oil, vegetable oil. IMO less is more.
    4. **Add seasonings**. Baseline seasonings: Kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne.
    5. **Roast**. See "specifics".
