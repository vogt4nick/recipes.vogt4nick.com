=== "Ingredients"
    * Eggs
    * Water
    * 2 T White Vinegar
    * Ice Water

=== "Directions"
    1. **Hardboil eggs.** Boil water and white vinegar to a stockpot. Gently add eggs so the shell doesn't crack and spill loose egg whites throughout the boiling water. Boil 8 minutes.
    2. **Shock eggs.** Immediately transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water. Cool completely.
    3. **Peel and serve.**

??? question "Why add vinegar to the boiling water?"
    The acidity from the vinegar will help break down the shell and make the hardboiled eggs easier to peel. Since the vinegar will permeate the shell, it breaks down the shell on both sides.

??? question "Why shock the eggs in ice water?"
    The rapid cooling of the eggs contracts the egg whites, releasing them from the egg's membrane. It also firms the egg white proteins, making them easier to peel.
