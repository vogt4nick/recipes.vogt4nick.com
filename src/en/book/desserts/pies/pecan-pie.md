    1. **Preheat oven** to 180ºC (350ºF).
    2. **Make sugar mixture.** Bring corn syrup and brown sugar to boil, and remove from heat. Mix in butter. Cool 10 minutes so that it won't cook the eggs in the next step.
    3. **Temper eggs.** Beat eggs. Slowly beat sugar mixture to eggs.
    4. **Fill pie.** Mix pecans, vanilla, and salt into tempered egg mixture. Pour filling into pie crust.
    5. **Bake** 45 minutes at 180ºC.
