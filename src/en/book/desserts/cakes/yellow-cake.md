=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oven** to 180ºC (350ºF). Grease two 9-inch springform pans and line with parchment paper.
    2. **Combine dry mix.** Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
    3. **Combine wet mix.** Cream butter and sugar. Add egg yolks, and vanilla, and whip until combined.
    4. **Make batter.** Slowly add dry mix and buttermilk to wet mix while beating to combine: add 100 g dry mix and 120 g buttermilk and beat until combined; add another 100 g dry mix and the rest of the buttermilk and continue beating until combined; add rest of the dry mix and continue beating until combined.
    5. **Whip egg whites** and cream of tartar to stiff peaks. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter—careful to avoid over-mixing.
    6. **Pour** batter into cake pans.
    7. **Bake.** Bake at 180ºC for 30 minutes until the cakes are baked through; after 18 minutes, tent with aluminum foil.
    8. **Cool.** Set aside cakes on a wire rack at room temperature until completely cooled.
    9. **Frost and serve.**
