=== "Ingredients"
    * 150 g Granulated Sugar
    * 4 t Orange Zest
    * 2 Large Eggs, beaten
    * 2 Large Egg Yolks, beaten
    * 180 g Orange Juice
    * 50 g Lemon Juice
    * 90 g Unsalted Butter, divided into 15 g cubes
    * 1 [Tart Crust, blind-baked](../../bread/pastry-doughs/tart-crust.md)

=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oven** to 160ºC (325ºF).
    2. **Infuse sugar.** Rub orange zest into sugar.
    3. **Foam eggs.** Whisk sugar and eggs together.
    4. **Add fruit juice.** Slowly whisk in fruit juice, so as not to break the emulsion.
    5. **Make curd.** Heat emulsion over low heat, whisking constantly. When the curd is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, then incrementally whisk in butter cubes. Mix until curd is smooth.
    6. **Bake.** Pour curd into blind-baked tart crust. Bake 20-30 minutes at 160ºC (325ºF).
    7. **Chill** 6-24 hours until firm.

!!! tip "Use fresh eggs; fresh eggs will foam easier than older ones."
