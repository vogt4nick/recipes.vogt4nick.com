=== "Directions"
    1. **Make sauce.** Combine 75 g cranberries, water, orange juice, and sugar in saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Lower heat to maintain a low simmer. Reduce 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cranberries burst and sauce thickens. Remove from heat. Add remaining cranberries, orange zest, and vanilla. Set aside to cool slightly.
    2. **Preheat oven** to 200ºC (400ºF). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan.
    3. **Prepare dough.** Prepare a lightly floured surface. Roll pastry dough into a ~12x16-inch rectangle. Cut dough into 12 4-inch squares. Prepare egg wash by whisking egg and water. Brush all over pastry puff squares. Transfer squares to muffin pan and press down to fill each cup.
    4. **Fill tarts.** Place one brie slice in center of each dough cup. Top each with 2-3 t cranberry sauce. Fold corners toward center of each tart. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.
    5. **Bake** 10 minutes at 200ºC. Place pecans in the center of each tart. Bake 10 minutes more until tarts are golden brown.
    6. **Garnish** with thyme and sea salt.
    7. **Cool** 5 minutes and remove from pan.
    8. **Serve warm.**
