=== "Directions"
    1. **Make yudane.** Mix the flour and boiling water until there is no dry flour left. Cover, and rest until completely cooled.
    2. **Mix dough.** Mix water, yeast, salt, sugar, and egg yolk to dissolve the salt and sugar. Mix in the yudane and the flour. Knead 3 minutes into a workable dough.
    3. **Enrich dough.** Stretch dough out. Place butter in the middle, and fold dough around butter. Press the butter into the dough, tearing it using Charlie's method.[^charlie_youtube]
    4. **Knead.** Knead 6 minutes, beginning with slap & fold before continuing with your regular kneading method.
    5. **Ferment.** Rest 1 hour, covered, at room temperature. Fold, and ferment 1 hour more, covered, at room temperature.
    6. **Roll out** dough, brush with butter, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
    7. **Shape.** Roll up the dough, and seal the edge. Cut the roll into 6 pieces. Tuck end piece underneath each roll.
    8. **Proof.** Arrange dough buns on greased sheetpan, and rest 2 hours at room temperature.
    9.  **Preheat oven** to 160ºC (320ºF).
    10. **Glaze** dough buns with egg white.
    11. **Bake** 23 minutes at 160ºC (320ºF).
    12. **Cool** to room temperature.
    13. **Frost buns.** Mix frosting ingredients thoroughly, and frost buns before serving.

    !!! tip "Knead in additional flour as necessary, but be mindful that a wetter dough will yield lighter, fluffier cinnamon rolls."
