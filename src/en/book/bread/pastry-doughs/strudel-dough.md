=== "Ingredients"
    * 125 g Flour
    * 1/2 t Salt
    * 60 g Water, room temperature
    * 1 t Olive Oil
    * For Baking
        * Neutral Oil
        * Flour
        * 1 Egg, beaten

=== "Directions"
    1. **Form dough.** Mix flour and salt to combine evenly. Add oil and water, and mix into a shaggy dough. Knead 5-7 minutes until a soft dough forms.
    2. **Rest.** Coat dough ball lightly in oil, wrap in plastic wrap to prevent drying out, and rest 30 minutes.
    3. **Preheat oven** to 180ºC (350ºF).
    4. **Prepare a large surface** --- at least 80 x 80 cm. Dress it with table cloth. Flour lightly.
    5. **Grease sheet pan** lightly with oil and flour.
    6. **Stretch.**[^grannies] Transfer dough to a floured surface. Roll out into a circle the size of a large plate. Supporting the dough with the back of your hands and working form the inside outward, stretch the dough thinly. Transfer to stretching surface. Working from the still not-thin-enough edges, stretch the dough into a large rectangle.
    7. **Fill strudel.**
    8. **Roll up.** Fold four sides like a galette. Supporting the strudel with the table cloth, roll up the strudel, and transfer to sheetpan.
    9. **Egg wash.**
    10. **Bake** 35 minutes at 180ºC (350ºF).

    !!! info "The dough must be very thin, such that you can read a newspaper through it."
