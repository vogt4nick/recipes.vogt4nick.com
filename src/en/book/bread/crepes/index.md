=== "Ingredients"
    * Dry Mix
        * 130 g Flour
        * 1/4 t Salt
        * 1 t Sugar (optional)
        * 1/4 t Cinnamon (optional)
    * 2 Eggs, beaten
    * 280 g Milk
    * 25 g Olive Oil

    !!! info "These ingredients make four (4) crepes."

    !!! note "Whisk eggs until you can lift your fork/whisk out and it drizzles in one strand, not lumpish."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix dry mix** ingredients together.
    2. **Make batter.** Combine eggs, milk, and olive oil. Whisk briefly. Slowly add in dry mix. There will be lumps, but try for no lumps.
    3. **Rest batter** at least 5 minutes.
    4. **Heat pan** to medium heat.
    5. **Cook crepes.** For each crepe: Add 120-140 g of batter to the preheated pan. Cook 2-5 minutes until golden brown. Flip, and continue cooking an additional 60 seconds.

    ??? tip "Flipping is an art."
        You will likely need 2 implements to manage the flip: a rubber spatula for getting under the edge and then a hard spatula for doing the actual flipping. Handle with care."
