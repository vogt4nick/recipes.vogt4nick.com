=== "Directions"
    1. **Refresh chef.** Mix mother culture, flour, and water until just incorporated. Rest 2 hours, uncovered. Seal, and rest at room temperature about 24 hours.
    2. **Preferment levain.** Mix restored levain, flours, and water until just incorporated. Rest 2 hours, uncovered. Seal, and rest at room temperature for 6-8 hours.
    3. **Autolyse.** Blend the flours until homogenous. Add water, and mix until just incorporated. Cover and rest 20-30 minutes.
    4. **Mix.** Add salt, yeast, and preferment to the autolysed dough, and mix by hand using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s). The temperature after mixing should be 25ºC-26ºC (77ºF-78ºF).
