=== "Directions"
    1. **Refresh chef.** Mix mother culture, flour, and water until just incorporated. Seal, and rest 12 hours at room temperature.
    2. **Preferment levain.** Mix restored levain, flour, and water until just incorporated. Seal, and rest 12 hours at room temperature.
    3. **Autolyse.** Blend the flours and rye chops until homogenous. Add water, and mix until just incorporated. Cover and rest 45 minutes.
    4. **Moisten preferment** with water.
    5. **Mix.** Add salt and moistened preferment to the autolysed dough, and mix by hand using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s) until becomes a homogenous mass.
    6. **Knead.** Slap & fold 2 minutes to develop gluten.
    7. **Bulk ferment** 9 hours total. Knead intermittently for the first 3h 30m: for the first hour, briefly slap & fold every 15 minutes; rest one hour; for the final 1h 30m, briefly slap & fold every 30 minutes. Finally, rest another 5h 30m.
    8. **Shape** into a medium-tight ball.
    9. **Proof** 18 hours in refrigerator.
    10. **Preheat oven** to 250ºC (482ºF).
    11. **Preheat dutch oven** with its lid at least 45 minutes.
    12. **Bake** 35 minutes covered. Remove lid, and continue baking 20 minutes until dark brown all around the loaf.
    13. **Cool** loaf at room temperature at least 20 minutes.

    ??? question "Why do I continue kneading through bulk fermentation?"
        Gluten development in rye is weaker than in wheat. Without the additional kneading, the resulting loaf would be very dense and would struggle to rise.
