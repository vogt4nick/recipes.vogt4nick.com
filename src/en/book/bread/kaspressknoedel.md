=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oven** to 200ºC (425ºF) and grease a sheetpan.
    2. **Soak the bread cubes** in milk at room temperature for at least 5 minutes.
    3. **Heat the vegetable broth.**
    4. **Sweat onion** and garlic in butter until soft.
    5. **Combine ingredients.** Mix soaked bread cubes, sautéed onions, cheese, egg, and seasonings together in a large bowl to form a rather soft mass.
    6. **Rest.** Let the mixture rest at least 30 minutes at room temperature.
    7. **Shape the dumplings.** With damp hands, form six, gently pressed dumplings --- if it starts to fall apart, you're pressing too hard! Arrange dumplings on a sheet pan.
    8. **Bake.**  Bake 8 minutes at 200ºC (425ºF). Flip the dumplings, and continue baking another 8 minutes.
    9. **Serve** in vegetable broth in a shallow bowl --- the dumplings must not be fully submerged.
