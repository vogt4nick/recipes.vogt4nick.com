There are two kinds of dry yeast: instant dry yeast and active dry yeast. **Instant dry yeast** can be used directly with no activation. **Active dry yeast** is similar, but requires a brief 10 minute soak in warm water before using.

Use the following multiplication table to substitute depending on which dry yeast you have available.[^chainbaker]

| Instant Dry Yeast | Active Dry Yeast |
| ----------------: | ---------------: |
|               1 g |           1.21 g |
|           0.825 g |              1 g |
