=== "Ingredients"
    * 180 g Bread Flour or All-Purpose Flour
    * 1/2 t Kosher Salt
    * 2 t Baking Powder
    * 240 g Plain Greek Yogurt
    * 4 Garlic Cloves, crushed
    * 60 g Scallions, thinly sliced
    * 2 T Unsalted Butter, melted

    !!! info "Yields 6 flatbreads."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix dry ingredients.** Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder evenly in a bowl.
    2. **Mix shaggy dough.** Add in Greek yogurt gently. Take a wooden spoon and slowly start mixing everything together. Keep mixing, stirring, and pressing until a shaggy dough forms.
    3. **Knead dough.** Transfer dough to a work surface and use your hands to press dough together. Knead 3-5 minutes until dough becomes elastic and a little bit sticky.
    4. **Rest.** Wrap in plastic and rest 15-20 minutes at room temperature.
    5. **Roll naan**. Prepare a lightly floured surface. Divide dough into six equal pieces. Use a rolling pin to roll dough until it's about 3 mm thick.
    6. **Cook naan**. Heat frying pan over high heat. Add flatbread to pan. Cook 60 seconds. Flip. Cook 60 seconds. Remove from heat.
    7. **Serve.** Brush naan with butter and serve.

    !!! caution "Add a bit more flour as necessary when kneading, but try to keep extra flour at an absolute minimum."

    ??? question "How do I roll the dough so thin?"
        Chef John has a [good video segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfObqgc0TnQ&t=4m) on rolling the dough super thin.

    !!! tip "Stack and cover cooked naan breads with a kitchen towel to keep warm and moist while you cook the other naan breads."

???+ note "Variation: Scallion Garlic Naan"
    Add finely sliced scallions and minced garlic when adding yogurt.
