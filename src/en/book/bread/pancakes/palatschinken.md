=== "Ingredients"
    * 120 g Flour
    * Kosher Salt
    * 1 Egg
    * 250 g Milk
    * For Serving
        * Jam or Marmelade

    !!! info "These amounts yield 2-3 large palatschinken."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat pan** over medium heat.
    2. **Mix batter** until the flour just disappears.
    3. **Cook.** Dividing batter as necessary, pour in batter and gently shape to form roughly circular palatschinken. Cook 3 minutes per side until golden brown on both sides.
    4. **Fill** with jam and roll gently and firmly.

    !!! info "There may be small chunks of flour in the batter that won't easily mix in. This is fine."
