title: Yeast doughs
---
There are three kinds of yeast: instant dry yeast, active dry yeast, and levain. **Instant dry yeast** can be used directly with no activation. **Active dry yeast** is similar, but requires a brief 10 minute soak in warm water before using. **Levain**, in contrast, is a fermented starter dough. All three yeasts are mostly interchangeable as leavening agents, however levain will likely impart different flavors depending on its preparation.

Use the following multiplication table to substitute depending on which yeast you have available.[^chainbaker]

| Instant Dry Yeast | Active Dry Yeast | Levain |
| ----------------: | ---------------: | -----: |
|               1 g |           1.21 g |    3 g |
|           0.825 g |              1 g |  2.5 g |
|           0.333 g |            0.4 g |    1 g |
