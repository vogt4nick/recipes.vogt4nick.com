=== "Ingredients"
    * Whole Wheat Flour, room temperature
    * White Flour, room temperature
    * Water

=== "Making the Levain"
    1. **Record mass.** Weigh the container without the lid, and record its mass on a piece of tape that you attach to the outside of the container.
    2. **Day 1.** Mix 100 g whole wheat flour with 100 g water at 38ºC (100ºF). Rest 2 hours, uncovered, at room temperature. Seal, and rest at room temperature.
    3. **Day 2.** Mix in 100 g whole wheat flour with 100 g water at 38ºC (100ºF). Rest 2 hours, uncovered, at room temperature. Seal, and rest at room temperature.
    4. **Day 3.** Discard half of the culture by mass. Mix in 100 g whole wheat flour with 100 g water at 38ºC (100ºF). Seal, and rest at room temperature.
    5. **Day 4.** Discard three-fourths of the culture by mass. Mix in 100 g whole wheat flour with 100 g water at 30ºC (87ºF). Seal, and rest at room temperature.
    6. **Day 5.** Discard all but 50 g of the culture. Mix in 75 g whole wheat flour, 75 g white flour, and 150 g water at 30ºC (87ºF). Seal, and rest at room temperature.
    7. **Day 6.** Discard all but 50 g of the culture. Mix in 100 g white flour with 100 g water at 30ºC (87ºF). Seal, and rest at room temperature.
    8. **Day 7.** Transfer culture to refrigerator and chill until needed.

    ??? caution "Do not start or boost the levain with commercial yeast!"
        All commercial yeast uses one common yeast species, _saccharomyces cerevisiae_, which is more vigorous than wild yeasts. Adding even a small amount of commercial yeast will ultimately result in the commercial yeast dominating and eventually starving out the wild yeasts, ultimately defeating the purpose of a homemade levain.[^forkish_flour]

=== "Feeding the Levain"
    1. **Discard** all but 25 g of the levain from its container.
    2. **Mix** in 100 g white flour with 100 g water at 30ºC (87ºF).
    3. **Rest** 12 hours, sealed, at room temperature.
    4. **Chill** until needed in the refrigerator.

    !!! info "Feed the levain culture every 7-10 days."

=== "Tuning Flavors"
    Ken Forkish highlights three key variables influencing levain cultures:[^forkish_flour]

    1. **Hydration.** More liquid leads to greater production of lactic acid. stiffer cultures have a flavor profile more dominated by acetic acid.
    2. **Temperature.** Warmer temperatures from 26ºC-32ºC (78ºF-90ºF) favor lactic acid production. Cooler temperatures from 13ºC-18ºC (55ºF-65ºF) favor acetic acid production. Warmer cultures also develop faster.
    3. **Flour.** High-extraction flours, whole grain wheat or rye flours, and high-ash flours all contribute to more vigorous fermentation. They can also create a volatile culture that requires more frequent feedings to prevent problems. Every type of flour and blend of flours also has its own character which will be imparted onto the levain.

    Lactic acid and acetic acid are both organic acids that can affect the flavor of bread. Lactic acid is produced by the fermentation of sugars by bacteria, and it can contribute a tangy or sour flavor to bread. Acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by bacteria, and it can contribute a sharp, acidic, wine-like flavor to bread. The flavor of bread can be influenced by the type and amount of acid present, as well as the other ingredients used in the dough and the baking process. Some breads, such as sourdough bread, rely on the production of lactic and acetic acids to give them their characteristic tangy flavor.
