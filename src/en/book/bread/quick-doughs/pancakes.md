    1. **Mix batter.** Sift dry ingredients, and whisk to combine. Whisk in milk and egg until dry ingredients are just combined.
    2. **Rest** 5 minutes to allow baking powder time to react the fluids at an even pace.
    3. **Preheat** thin coat of oil in heavy pan or skillet over medium-high heat.
    4. **Cook.** Dividing as necessary, pour 60 g batter per pancake. When bubbles begin to rise through the middle of the pancake, flip, and continue cooking until fully set.
    5. **Serve** with butter and maple syrup.
