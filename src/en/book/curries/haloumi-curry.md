=== "Directions"
    1. **Grill haloumi.** Heat oil in saucepan over low-medium heat. Grill haloumi on one side until golden brown and set aside.
    2. **Temper spices.** Add remaining oil and raise to medium heat. Stir in cumin seed. When seeds begin to crack, add garlic and ginger, and saute 30 seconds until fragrant. Add bell pepper and saute 30 seconds more. Stir in remaining spices, and cook 30 seconds more.
    3. **Cook curry.** Add tomatoes, salt, and sugar. Stir and cook 3 minutes until tomatoes are just tender. Add haloumi, and cook 5 minutes until spices are well integrated --- do not allow tomatoes to break down. Remove from heat.
    4. **Season** with garam masala, and serve.

    !!! tip "The oil is hot enough when adding one cumin seed to the oil causes the seed to crack immediately."

    !!! info "The tomato mixture will separate from the oil."
