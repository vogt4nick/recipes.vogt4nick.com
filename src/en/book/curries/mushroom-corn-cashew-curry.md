=== "Directions"
    1. **Blend tomato puree.** Blend the tomatoes, cashews, ginger and green chili to make creamy paste. Set aside.
    2. **Make curry.** Heat oil in saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cumin seeds. After 15-30 seconds, or when the cumin seeds crack, add the tomato puree, coriander, turmeric, paprika, and salt. Cook 3-4 minutes until it's reduced by about half.
    3. **Mix in corn and mushrooms**, and add water. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until corn and mushrooms are tender and curry has a thick consistency.
    4. **Serve** over rice and garnished with cilantro.

    !!! tip "The oil is hot enough when adding one cumin seed to the oil causes the seed to crack immediately."

    !!! info "The tomato mixture will separate from the oil."
