    1. **Whisk wet mix.** Combine egg yolks, flour, milk, white sugar, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl. Whisk until batter is smooth.
    2. **Beat egg whites.** Combine egg whites and lemon juice in bowl, and beat until soft peaks form.
    3. **Fold egg whites into wet mix.** Add egg whites to wet mix, and gently fold in using a spatula until just combined.
    4. **Cook.** Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Transfer batter into the hot pan, cover, and cook 4 minutes until the bottom is golden brown and bubbles appear on the surface.
    5. **Chop.** Use a spatula to cut the pancake into 4 sections and flip over. Cover and cook for another minute. Use 2 spatulas to tear or cut the pancake into 1 to 2 inch pieces.
    6. **Finish.** Add remaining butter in little pieces to the pan and sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons white sugar. Cook tossing and stirring for a few minutes until pancake pieces are lightly caramelized at the edges.
