=== "Directions"
    1. **Preferment levain.** Mix levain, flours, and water until just incorporated. Seal, and rest at room temperature for 12-24 hours.
    2. **Autolyse.** Blend the flours until homogenous. Add water, and mix until just incorporated. Cover and rest 20-30 minutes.
    3. **Mix.** Add salt, yeast, and preferment to the autolysed dough, and mix by hand using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s). The temperature after mixing should be 25ºC-26ºC (77ºF-78ºF).
    4. **Bulk fermentation.** Rest 1h 30m. Fold three or four times. Rest an additional 3h 30m until the dough is 2.5x its original volume.
    5. **Shape** into a medium-tight ball. Arrange seam side down for proofing.
    6. **Proof (optional)** 12-14 hours (overnight) in the refrigerator in a non-perforated plastic bag.
    7. **Preheat oven** to 250ºC (482ºF).
    8. **Preheat dutch oven** with its lid at least 45 minutes.
    9. **Bake** 35 minutes covered. Remove lid, and continue baking 20 minutes until dark brown all around the loaf.
    10. **Cool** loaf at room temperature at least 20 minutes.
