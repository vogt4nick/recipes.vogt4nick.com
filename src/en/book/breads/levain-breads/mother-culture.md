!!! info "The mother culture, or _chef_, can be used straight out of the fridge for any recipe in this section."

=== "Ingredients"
    * Whole Wheat Flour, room temperature
    * Water

    ??? tip "Prefer whole grain flours for starting the mother culture."
        Technically any grain, refined or otherwise, will work, but whole grains including the bran, germ, and endosperm provided better nutrition to the yeast.

        Only after the mother culture is started should you may switch to refined versions of the starter grain.

    ??? caution "Use a consistent grain or blend!"
        Different grains are better suited to different yeast species. An inconsistent grain or blend may hinder development.

    ??? caution "Do not start or boost the levain with commercial yeast!"
        All commercial yeast uses one common yeast species, _saccharomyces cerevisiae_, which is more vigorous than wild yeasts. Adding even a small amount of commercial yeast will ultimately result in the commercial yeast dominating and eventually starving out the wild yeasts, ultimately defeating the purpose of a homemade levain.[^forkish_flour]

=== "Starting the Culture"
    1. **Document grain(s).** Record the grain or blend you chose on a piece of tape, and attach to the outside of the container.
    2. **Record weight.** Weigh the container without the lid. Record it on a piece of tape, and attach to the outside of the container.
    3. **Day 1.** Mix 100 g flour and 100 g water at 29ºC-32ºC (85ºF-90ºF) until just incorporated. Rest 2 hours, uncovered. Seal, and rest at room temperature for one day.
    4. **Day 2.** Reserve 50 g of the mixture, discarding the rest. Mix in 100 g flour and 100 g water at 29ºC-32ºC (85ºF-90ºF) until just incorporated. Rest 2 hours, uncovered. Seal, and rest at room temperature for one day.
    5. **Repeat day 2 as necessary.** At this stage the levain should be 2x larger by volume, with bubbles throughout and a leathery alcohol smell. Repeat day 2 as necessary until this condition is met.
    6. **Day 3.** Reserve 50 g of the mixture, discarding the rest. Mix in 100 g flour and 100 g water at 29ºC-32ºC (85ºF-90ºF) until just incorporated. Rest 2 hours, uncovered. Seal, and rest at room temperature for one day.
    7. **Repeat day 3 as necessary.** At this stage the levain should be 2x larger by volume, with bubbles throughout and a distinctly pungent, sour odor. Repeat day 3 as necessary until this condition is met.
    8. **Day 4.** Reserve 40 g of the mixture, discarding the rest. Mix in 100 g flour and 100 g water at 29ºC-32ºC (85ºF-90ºF) until just incorporated. Seal, and rest at room temperature for one day.
    9. **Feed.**

=== "Feeding, Storing, and Refreshing"
    1. **Rest** 1 hour at room temperature.
    2. **Reserve** 20 g of chef, discarding the rest.
    3. **Hydrate** with 80 g water at 29ºC-32ºC (85ºF-90ºF).
    4. **Refresh** with 100 g flour.
    5. **Mix** until just incorporated.
    6. **Rest** 2 hours, uncovered.
    7. **Seal.** Coat with a film of water and seal.
    8. **Store** in refrigerator for up to 30 days.

??? question "How do I tune flavors?"
    Ken Forkish highlights three key variables influencing levain cultures:[^forkish_flour]

    1. **Hydration.** More liquid leads to greater production of lactic acid. stiffer cultures have a flavor profile more dominated by acetic acid.
    2. **Temperature.** Warmer temperatures from 26ºC-32ºC (78ºF-90ºF) favor lactic acid production. Cooler temperatures from 13ºC-18ºC (55ºF-65ºF) favor acetic acid production. Warmer cultures also develop faster.
    3. **Flour.** High-extraction flours, whole grain wheat or rye flours, and high-ash flours all contribute to more vigorous fermentation. They can also create a volatile culture that requires more frequent feedings to prevent problems. Every type of flour and blend of flours also has its own character which will be imparted onto the levain.

    Lactic acid and acetic acid are both organic acids that can affect the flavor of bread. Lactic acid is produced by the fermentation of sugars by bacteria, and it can contribute a tangy or sour flavor to bread. Acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by bacteria, and it can contribute a sharp, acidic, wine-like flavor to bread. The flavor of bread can be influenced by the type and amount of acid present, as well as the other ingredients used in the dough and the baking process. Some breads, such as sourdough bread, rely on the production of lactic and acetic acids to give them their characteristic tangy flavor.
