=== "Directions"
    1. **Preferment levain.** Mix levain, flours, and water until just incorporated. Seal, and rest 9-10 hours.
    2. **Fry bacon** until crisp. Reserve bacon fat, and remove bacon from heat. Cool to room temperature and crumble.
    3. **Autolyse.** Blend the flours until homogenous. Add water, and mix until just incorporated. Cover and rest 20-30 minutes.
    4. **Mix.** Add salt and preferment to the autolysed dough, and mix by hand using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s). The temperature after mixing should be 25ºC-26ºC (77ºF-78ºF). Rest 10 minutes Mix in bacon and rendered fat, again with pincer method, until the bacon and fat are evenly distributed.
    5. **Bulk fermentation.** Rest 2 hours. Fold three or four times. Rest an additional 10 hours until the dough is 2.5x its original volume.
    6. **Shape** into a medium-tight ball. Arrange seam side down for proofing.
    7. **Proof** 4 hours in the refrigerator in a non-perforated plastic bag.
    8.  **Preheat oven** to 250ºC (482ºF).
    9.  **Preheat dutch oven** with its lid at least 45 minutes.
    10. **Bake** 30 minutes covered. Remove lid, and continue baking 20 minutes until dark brown all around the loaf.
    11. **Cool** loaf at room temperature at least 20 minutes.
