=== "Directions"
    1. **Preferment levain.** Mix levain, flours, and water until just incorporated. Seal, and rest at room temperature for 8-10 hours.
    2. **Autolyse.** Blend the flours until homogenous. Add water, and mix until just incorporated. Cover and rest 45 minutes.
    3. **Mix soaker.** Combine oats and water, cover, and rest 45 minutes.
    4. **Mix.** Add salt, yeast, soaker, and preferment to the autolysed dough, and mix by hand using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s). The temperature after mixing should be 25ºC-26ºC (77ºF-78ºF).
    5. **Bulk fermentation.** Rest 1h 30m. Slap & fold a few times. Rest an additional 3h 30m until the dough is 2.5x its original volume.
    6. **Shape** into a medium-tight ball. Arrange seam side down for proofing.
    7. **Proof (optional)** 12-14 hours in the refrigerator in a non-perforated plastic bag.
    8. **Preheat oven** to 250ºC (482ºF).
