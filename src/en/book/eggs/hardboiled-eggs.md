=== "Ingredients"
    * Eggs
    * Water

=== "Directions"
    1. **Steam eggs** 11 minutes.
    2. **Shock eggs.** Immediately transfer eggs to a bowl of cold water. Cool completely.
    3. **Peel and serve.**

??? question "Why shock the eggs in cold water?"
    The rapid cooling of the eggs contracts the egg whites, releasing them from the egg's membrane. It also firms the egg white proteins, making them easier to peel.
