=== "Ingredients"
    * Fond
    * Reserved Drippings or Butter
    * 2 T Flour
    * 500 g [Stock](../soups/stocks/meat-stock.md), cold

=== "Directions"
    1. **Separate fond from drippings** by pouring the drippings into a separate container.
    2. **Make dry roux.** Heat pan over low heat. Add flour and combine with any residual fat in the pan. Toast 5 minutes until aromatic.
    3. **Make gravy.** About 100 g at a time, pour in some stock, scrape up the fond, and stir to combine with the roux. Bring to simmer over low heat, stirring, until all fond releases from the bottom of the pan.
    4. **Adjust to taste** by adding more stock or reducing to desired consistency, seasoning, and/or straining.

    !!! tip "The roux should be dry! But if it's too dry, add some of the reserved drippings to bring to desired consistency."

!!! info "This recipe is ideal for any roasted meat in a heavy pan."
