    * 1/2 t Dried Cayenne Pepper, ground

    !!! tip "Simply squeeze potato hash to dry them without using a towel."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Heat fat** in a heavy frying pan over medium-high heat.
    2. **Add potato hash** and spread into an even layer. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
    3. **Cover and fry** 5 minutes. Flip hash browns. Remove from heat. Cover again, and allow residual heat from pan to fry 5 minutes more.
