=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare pota-dough.** Mash potatoes into large bowl. Add ricotta, egg, flour, salt, thyme. Mix. Transfer dough to well-floured surface. Knead gently.
    2. **Shape dumplings.** Divide batch as necessary; roll *pota-dough* into 2 cm thick rope. Cut 3 cm dumplings from rope. [Dimple the dumplings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTmcGy9CWhE&t=175s).
    3. **Cook dumplings.** Add water and olive oil to stockpan. Boil over high heat. Divide batch as necessary; add dumplings to stockpan. Note that dumplings are cooked when they begin to float.
    4. **Sear dumplings.** Heat remaining olive oil frying pan over medium-high heat. Transfer *cooked dumplings* to frying pan. Add black pepper. Cook 2 minutes until brown. Flip. Cook 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
    5. **Garnish and serve** with parsley.

    ??? question "I don't have a potato masher. How do I make pota-dough?"
        Smitten Kitchen recommends a box grater if you don't have a potato masher; but IME this produces chunky gnocci.

    ??? tip "Dimple the gnocchi before cooking."
        Adding dimples to the dumplings helps them retain their shape and cook evenly while boiling.
