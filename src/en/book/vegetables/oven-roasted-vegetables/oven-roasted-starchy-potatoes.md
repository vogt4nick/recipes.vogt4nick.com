=== "Ingredients"
    * 2 T Salt
    * 1/2 t Baking Soda
    * 900 g Starchy Potatoes, peeled, quartered
    * 80 g Cooking Fat
    * 3 sprigs Rosemary Leaves
    * 1/2 T Black Peppercorn, ground
    * 1/2 T Kosher Salt
    * For Serving
        * 90 g Sour Cream (optional)

=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare materials.** Preheat oven to 450ºF (232ºC). Prepare a foiled sheetpan.
    2. **Boil potatoes.** Add potatoes, salt, baking soda, and water (enough to cover the mixture) to stockpan. Stir. Boil 6 minutes until nearly cooked-through. Strain**.
    3. **Dry potatoes.** Rest potatoes 15 minutes until done steaming.
    4. **Season potatoes** with spices and oil.
    5. **Roast potatoes.** Move to prepared sheetpan. Spread evenly so no potatoes are touching. Roast 50 minutes at 450ºF, turning every 20 minutes.
    6. **Serve** with sour cream for dipping.

    ??? warning "Do not drain in a fine mesh colander."
        We want to keep the dry, starchy outsides of the potatoes. These will crisp and help the texture. A fine colander will grate these off.
