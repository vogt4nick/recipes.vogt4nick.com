=== "Ingredients"
    * 500 g Heavy Cream
    * 2 Large Eggs
    * 1/2 T Kosher Salt
    * 1/2 t Black Peppercorn, ground
    * 1/2 t Nutmeg, grated
    * 3 Large Russet Potatoes, peeled, thinly sliced
    * 3 Large Sweet Potatoes, peeled, thinly sliced
    * 125 g Gruyere Cheese, shredded
    * Flat-leaf Parsley Leaves chopped

=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oven** to 180ºC (350ºF), and grease a casserole dish.
    2. **Season.** Combine cream, eggs, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Whisk until just blended. Add potatoes and toss to coat evenly.
    3. **Layer.** Transfer mixture to the prepared casserole dish. Spread the potatoes into an even layer, and press them lightly to better absorb the liquid. Layer parsley first and the cheese second.
    4. **Bake.** Cover casserole dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake 45 minutes at 180ºC. Remove foil, and continue baking 15-20 minutes until golden, bubbling, and cooked through.
    5. **Rest** 10 minutes before serving.
