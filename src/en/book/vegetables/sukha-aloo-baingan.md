=== "Directions"
    1. **Cook eggplant.** Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Cook mustard and cumin seed 30 seconds until fragrant, add onion, and cook onion until translucent. Stir eggplant and turmeric to coat evenly. Cook uncovered 8-10 minutes until eggplant is tender.
    2. **Make ding chik.** Pulverize garlic and cumin seeds; add mixture to bottom of skillet, and cook 1 minute until raw garlic aroma dissipates. Add zest, green chili, paprika, cayenne, and coriander seed, and cook 1 minute more. Finally, add potatoes, coconut flakes, and coriander leaves; stir to coat evenly, and cook until up to temperature.

    !!! info "The oil is hot enough when adding one cumin seed to the oil causes the seed to crack immediately."
