???+ quote "Chez Pim"
    [Sauce should] lead with a salty flavor, follow by a mild sourness, then just a gentle sweetness and a soft caress from the chili at the back of my throat at the very end.

=== "Ingredients"
    * 60 g Tamarind Pulp
    * 60 g Fish Sauce
    * 50 g Palm Sugar
    * 10 g Paprika

    !!! tip "Use tamarind pulp soaked only in water; no sugar, etc."

    ??? question "Substitutions"
        * Substitute soy sauce for fish sauce to make vegetarian
        * Substitute 30 g white or brown sugar for palm sugar
        * Substitute a hot chili powder for spicier sauce

=== "Directions"
    Add tamarind pulp, fish sauce, and sugar to small saucepan. Melt over low heat. Add paprika. Stir.
