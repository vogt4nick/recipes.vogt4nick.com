=== "Directions"
    1. **Combine cabbage mix.** Combine cabbage mix in colander. Rest at least 5 minutes, allowing salt to draw excess water from vegetables and drain.
    2. **Toast bread** in melted butter in frying pan until golden brown.
    3. **Combine egg patty mix.** Transfer drained cabbage mix to bowl. Whisk in egg until combined.
    4. **Cook egg patty.** Heat remaining butter in skillet over medium heat. Add egg patty mix. Cook and simultaneously mix by using the edge of a spatula to chop down on the surface while pushing the edges up and over the top. As the mixture starts to hold its shape, form into a rectangle that's about twice as long as it is wide. Split the rectangle in half and continue to cook until golden brown; flip and continue on the opposite side, 3 to 4 minutes total. Set aside.
    5. **Fry ham and cheese.** in the same skillet over medium heat until sizzling. Flip. Top ham with cheese. Cook 60 seconds until melted.
    6. **Dress sandwich.** Between two slices of toast, add
        * cooked cabbage mix
        * sugar
        * ham and cheese
        * mayonnaise and ketchup
    7. **Slice** diagonally and serve.
