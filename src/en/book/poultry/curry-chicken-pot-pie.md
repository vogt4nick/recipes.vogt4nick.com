=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat the oven** to 200ºC (400ºF).
    2. **Shape dough.** Seal seams of the puff pastry dough using a rolling pin. Dock the sheet by piercing it several times with a fork. Cut into 12 5-cm rounds, place on a half sheet pan, and cool in refrigerator while preparing the rest of the casserole.
    3. **Cook vegetables.** Melt butter in a large, straight-sided pan over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and sweat 5 minutes until the onion is translucent. Add the frozen vegetables and cook 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until heated through.
    4. **Heat cooking liquid.** While the vegetables are cooking, heat the broth and milk until almost boiling.
    5. **Mix casserole.** Add the remaining butter to the vegetables and melt. Add the flour and curry powder and whisk 1 minute until well integrated. Whisk in the liquid and cook 3-4 minutes until thickened. Add the parsley, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken, and stir to combine.
    6. **Bake casserole.** Pour into a large baking dish and mash down the mixture to compact the casserole. Top with the circles of puff pastry, spacing them so that they do not touch. Bake 25 minutes on the middle rack of the oven until the puff pastry has browned and the mixture is hot and bubbly.
    7. **Cool** at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.
