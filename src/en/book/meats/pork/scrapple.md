    * 160 g Dry Polenta or Cornmeal
    * 1/2 t Kosher Salt
    * Cornmeal or Flour, for dusting
    * Neutral Oil, for pan frying

    !!! info "Cornmeal will result in a much thicker scrapple."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Braise.** Combine pork shoulder, spices, and water in large saucepan. Bring to simmer, cover, and cook at a very low simmer for 2 hours until fork tender.
    2. **Chop pork.** Remove pork and roughly chop into bite sized pieces. Set aside.
    3. **Cook polenta.** Stir in salt and polenta, and simmer 30 minutes until very thick and tender.
    4. **Rest.** Combine polenta and meat mixture. Remove from heat, and rest 30 minutes to cool almost to room temperature.
    5. **Wrap.** Line a container with plastic wrap. Transfer scrapple, wrap and seal, and transfer to refrigerator.
    6. **Chill** 8-24 hours until fully chilled.
    7. **Unwrap.** Unwrap the scrapple, and slice 15 mm slices. Dust with cornmeal to dry surface.
    8. **Pan fry.** Heat oil in heavy pan over medium heat. Pan fry scrapple until browned and crispy.

    !!! info "Correct the amount of cooking liquid after braising if necessary: there should be about 720 g remaining."
