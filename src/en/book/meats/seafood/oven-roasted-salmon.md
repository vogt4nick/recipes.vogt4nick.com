    ??? question "Why add the salt directly before baking?"
        We risk overcooking the salmon if we don't correct for the loss in moisture caused by salting too early.[^tran]

    ??? question "How do I know if the salmon is cooked through?"
        For this recipe, the salmon should reach an internal temperature of 55ºC (130ºF).[^foodwishes]
