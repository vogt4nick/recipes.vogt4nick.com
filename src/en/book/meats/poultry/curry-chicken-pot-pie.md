=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat the oven** to 200ºC (400ºF).
    2. **Shape dough.** Seal seams of the puff pastry dough using a rolling pin. Dock the sheet by piercing it several times with a fork. Cut into 12 5-cm rounds, place on a half sheet pan, and cool in refrigerator while preparing the rest of the casserole.
    3. **Heat cooking liquid.** Add stock and milk to a saucepan. Heat to almost boiling, reduce to simmer, and cover.
    4. **Roast vegetable medley.** Add the frozen vegetables to a sheetpan or casserole dish. Roast 10 minutes at 200ºC.
    5. **Cook vegetables.** Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and salt, and sweat 5 minutes until the onion is translucent.
    6. **Mix roux.** Add the remaining butter to the onion and celery, and heat until melted. Add the flour and curry powder, and whisk 1 minute until well integrated.
    7. **Mix casserole.** Whisk in the liquid and cook 3-4 minutes until thickened. Stir in roasted vegetable medley, chicken, parsley and pepper, and stir to combine. Season to taste.
    8. **Transfer.** Pour casserole into a large baking dish and mash down the mixture to compact the casserole. Top with the circles of puff pastry, spacing them so that they do not touch.
    9. **Bake casserole.** 25 minutes at 200ºC until the puff pastry has browned and the mixture is hot and bubbly.
    10. **Cool** at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.
