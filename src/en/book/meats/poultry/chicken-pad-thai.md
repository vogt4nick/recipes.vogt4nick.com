=== "Ingredients"
    * 150 g [Pad Thai Sauce](../../sauces/thai-sauces/pad-thai-sauce.md)
    * 80 g Rice Sticks

    * 15 g Beansprouts
    * 15 g Pickled Turnips, chopped (optional)
    * 15 g Garlic Chives or Scallion Greens, roughly chopped
    * Lime, sliced

    !!! info "These ingredients are for one serving."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Warm sauce.** Simmer pad thai sauce over low heat.
    2. **Soak rice sticks** in warm water until pliable, but not soft enough to eat. Remove from water and pat dry.
    3. **Fry pad thai.** Heat oil in wok over high heat. Add chicken. Fry 2 minutes, tossing continuously, until halfway cooked. Add 1 tablespoon *warm pad thai sauce* and garlic. Fry 1 minute, tossing continuously. Add *softened rice sticks* and remaining *warm pad thai sauce*. Fry 1 minute**, tossing continuously, until noodle is soft. Push food to one side of pan to add egg directly to wok surface. Fry 15 seconds. Toss together once egg starts to cook. Add the peanuts, beansprouts, and pickled turnips. Fry 1 minute, tossing continuously. Add garlic chives. Remove wok from heat. Toss.
    4. **Serve** with remaining ground peanuts, paprika, fish sauce, and slivers of lime.

    ??? info "Prepare everything before cooking."
        Pad thai has to cook *fast*, and it can't cook fast if you're still crushing peanuts and slicing limes.

    !!! tip "Sprinkle a bit of water and keep stirring if the sauce evaporates and the noodles aren't ready."

    !!! tip "Between batches, rinse wok with warm water and wipe away solid bits."
