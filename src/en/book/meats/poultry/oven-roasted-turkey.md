=== "Ingredients"
    * Salt Blend
        * 2 T Kosher Salt
        * 1 T Black Peppercorn, ground
        * 1 T [Poultry Seasoning](../../seasonings/spice-blends/poultry-seasoning.md)
    * 2 Carrots, thickly chopped
    * 3 Celery Stalks, thickly chopped
    * 2 Onions, thickly chopped
    * Fresh Rosemary Leaves
    * Fresh Sage Leaves
    * [Turkey Butter](../../seasonings/compound-butters/turkey-butter.md)

=== "Directions"
    1. **Calculate roasting time.** Weigh turkey. Roasting time is 40 minutes per kilogram (or 18 minutes per pound).
    2. **Preheat oven** to 165ºC (325ºF).
    3. **Tuck wing tips** behind shoulders of turkey.
    4. **Prepare cavity.** Liberally season cavity with salt blend. Add a handful of mirepoix, followed by some rosemary and sage. Tie chicken legs together.
    5. **Season breasts.** Working from behind turkey, gently create space between skin and breast meat on either side --- be careful not separate skin from sternum. Apply butter liberally to both breasts under skin.
    6. **Season skin** with remaining butter and salt blend, covering turkey on all sides.
    7. **Fill roasting pan** with mirepoix. Lay turkey, breasts up, in pan on top of mirepoix. Fill pan with about 15-mm water. Cover turkey breasts with foil.
    8. **Roast** as per calculated roasting time at 165ºC (325ºF), removing foil from breasts halfway through cooking, until it reaches an internal temperature of 74ºC (165ºF) at thickest part of thigh.
    9. **Rest.** Cover breasts with foil again. Rest 45 minutes at room temperature.

    !!! tip "Foil over the breasts will prevent overcooking breasts and browning too deeply."
