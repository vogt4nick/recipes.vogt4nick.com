=== "Directions"
    1. **Blend** tomatoes, ginger, and green chili into a puree.
    2. **Make sauce.** Heat oil in saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cumin seeds. After 15-30 seconds, or when the cumin seeds crack, add the tomato puree, coriander, turmeric, and red chili powder. Cook 3-4 minutes until it's reduced by about half.
    3. **Mix in spinach**, salt, and water. Cover and cook 4-5 minutes until spinach has reduced in volume.
    4. **Add chickpeas** and mash them lightly with a spatula. Add more water as needed to keep the sauce consistency to your liking. Reduce heat to low, and cook 7-8 minutes, uncovered. Remove from heat and stir in the garam masala.

    !!! tip "The oil is hot enough when adding one cumin seed to the oil causes the seed to crack immediately."

    !!! info "The tomato mixture will separate from the oil."
