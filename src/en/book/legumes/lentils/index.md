=== "Ingredients"
    * 200 g Dry Lentils
    * 600 g Water or [Vegetable Stock](../../soups/stocks/vegetable-stock.md)
    * 1/2 t Kosher Salt (optional)

=== "Directions"
    1. **Rinse** lentils to remove any dust or debris.
    2. **Cook.** Add lentils and cooking liquid to a large saucepan. Bring to boil, cover tightly, reduce heat, and simmer until they are tender; for whole lentils, cook time is typically 15-20 minutes, and for split red lentils, cook time is typically only about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt, as desired.

    !!! info "Lentils do not require soaking like other legumes."

    !!! caution "Season with salt after cooking; if salt is added before, the lentils will become tough."
