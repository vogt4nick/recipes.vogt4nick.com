    !!! caution "Use a large container for soaking. Chickpeas will double in size."

    !!! question "Why discard the soaking water?"
        Soaking chickpeas removes lectins, which frequently causes indigestion.[^mcgee]

    !!! question "Why salt after cooking?"
        Salt both causes the chickpeas both to cook more slowly and hardens the texture, such that the chickpeas break rather than squash when pressed with a fork.[^mcgee]

!!! info "Store cooked chickpeas up to 4 days in water and chilled."
