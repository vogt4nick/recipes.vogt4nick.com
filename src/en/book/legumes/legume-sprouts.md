??? warning "Check toxicity before eating raw sprouted legumes."
    > Raw legumes contain toxins like lectins as a natural defence mechanism against predators.
    >
    > For some legumes like lentils and mung beans, the germination during sprouting neutralises the phytic acids and makes them safe to consume raw.
    >
    > For larger legumes, like chickpeas, itâ€™s recommended to still boil them until tender before eating.
    >
    > Some legumes, like red kidney beans contain an additional toxin called phytohaemagglutinin and, once sprouted, are not safe to be consumed raw.[^hermann_legumes]
