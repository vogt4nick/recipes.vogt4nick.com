    1. **Brine** and cover pork in fridge for 12 hours.
    2. **Rub** dry pork shoulder with seasonings.
    3. **Smoke** pork 10-12 hours in smoker at 210ºF (99ºC).
    4. **Rest** 60 minutes at room temperature, tented with foil.

    ??? question "Can I substitute white sugar or kosher salt?"
        Yes, but you won't get the same result. White sugar and kosher salt do not readily dissolve into water near 0ºC. Molasses and pickling salt, however, do stay dissolved into water at low temperatures.
