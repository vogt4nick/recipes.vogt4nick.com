=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oil.** Heat 6 cm canola oil to 375ºF (190ºC) in a large stockpan over medium-high heat.
    2. **Prepare dough.** Add flour and salt to food processor. Pulse evenly. Add butter bits. Chop until combined. Add yogurt. Pulse 10 times. Pulse, adding cold water 1 tablespoon at a time through the feed tube, until dough forms a ball. Remove dough from food processor. Knead 60 seconds by hand. Cover with damp towel and set aside.
    3. **Make filling.** Melt butter in frying pan over medium heat. Add onions and chiles. Stir. Cook 5 minutes, stirring every 60 seconds. Add remaining spices. Stir. Cook 2 minutes. Increase frying pan to medium-high heat. Add *parboiled potatoes* and peas. Cook 10 minutes, stirring every 60 seconds, until potatoes begin to brown. Remove from heat. Set aside as *samosa filling.*
    4. **Form samosas.** Prepare a lightly floured surface. Knead dough briefly by hand. Dividing as necessary, roll circular pockets 4 mm thick x 10 cm in diameter. Add 1 tablespoon filling to each samosa. Fold, crimp, and seal with a few drops of water as needed.
    5. **Fry samosas.** Prepare flat surface with paper bags or paper towels. Fry samosas 4 minutes until golden brown. Drain on prepared surface. Keep warm in oven until ready to serve.

    ??? tip "Try baked samosas"
        For less mess, bake samosas at 350ºF (177ºC) for 25 minutes until golden brown.

    !!! tip "Use the top of a mason jar to cut dough into perfect circles."
