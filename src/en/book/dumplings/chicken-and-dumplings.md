=== "Ingredients"
    * [Chicken Soup](../soups/chicken-soup.md)
    * 240 g White Wheat Flour
    * 1 T Baking Powder
    * 1 t Kosher Salt (optional)
    * 3 T Neutral Oil
    * 180 g Buttermilk

    !!! tip "Adjust salt according to the flavor of the chicken soup."

    !!! question "Substitute 2 t white vinegar and 180 g milk for 180 g buttermilk."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Simmer soup** in a large saucepan.
    2. **Combine dough.** Combine flour, baking powder, and salt into a homogenous mixture. Add oil and buttermilk, and mix into a shaggy dough. Roll dough into a smooth ball and transfer to a floured surface.
    3. **Pick dumplings.** Press flat the dough, and knead over a handful of times (instead of kneading). Roll into a cylinder. Pinch off 1 T of dough at a time or to desired size.
    4. **Simmer dumplings.** Add half the dumplings to the simmering soup, stir, and then add the remaining half. Simmer 5 minutes until done.

    !!! info "The consistency of the dumpling dough should more closely resemble a pie crust than a biscuit dough."

    !!! tip "Do not roll or otherwise shape the dumplings after picking them off the dough cylinder."
