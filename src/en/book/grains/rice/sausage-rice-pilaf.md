=== "Directions"
    1. **Fry sausage.** Heat olive oil in saucepan over medium heat. Add sausage, and fry until cooked. Remove sausage and set aside, retaining oil and sausage drippings in pan.
    2. **Sweat onion.** Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, salts, and pepper, and sweat 3 minutes until soft and translucent.
    3. **Toast rice.** Stir in rice to coat evenly. Toast 1 minute.
    4. **Cook.** Add stock and butter, bring to boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook 15 minutes. Finally, while covered, remove pan from heat and let stand for 10 minutes.
    5. **Fluff** rice with a fork, mix in sausage, and serve.

    ??? question "Why add the butter after sweating the onions?"
        Sweating onions first in olive oil before adding butter allows the onions to cook more gently and evenly and creates a sweeter, milder flavor, while saut√©ing onions in butter creates a nuttier, richer flavor and the Maillard reaction occurs.
