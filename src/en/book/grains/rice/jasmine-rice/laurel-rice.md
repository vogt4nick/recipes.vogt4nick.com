    * 1/2 T Olive Oil
    * 30 g Onion, minced
    * 1 Garlic Clove, minced
    * 4 Bay Leaves
    * 1/4 t [Celery Salt](../../../seasonings/salt-blends/celery-salt.md)
    * 1/4 t Kosher Salt
    * 1/4 t Black Peppercorn
    * 200 g Dry Jasmine Rice, rinsed
    * 320 g [Chicken Stock](../../../soups/stocks/meat-stock.md)
    * 1/2 T Butter

=== "Directions"
    1. **Sweat onion.** Heat olive oil in saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, salts, and pepper, and sweat 3 minutes until soft and translucent.
    2. **Toast rice.** Stir in rice to coat evenly. Toast 1 minute.
    3. **Cook.** Add stock and butter, bring to boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook 15 minutes. Finally, while covered, remove pan from heat and let stand for 10 minutes.
    4. **Fluff** rice with a fork.

    ??? question "Why add the butter after sweating the onions?"
        Sweating onions first in olive oil before adding butter allows the onions to cook more gently and evenly and creates a sweeter, milder flavor, while saut√©ing onions in butter creates a nuttier, richer flavor and the Maillard reaction occurs.

!!! tip "This rice is ideal for seafood."
