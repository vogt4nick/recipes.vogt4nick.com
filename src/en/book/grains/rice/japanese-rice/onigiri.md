    * 80 g Canned Tuna

    * For Handling
        * Salt Water

=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix tuna salad.** Combine tuna and kewpie mayo in a small bowl. Mix vigorously until mixture resembles a fluffy paste.
    2. **Shape onigiri** with damp (not wet) hands.

    !!! info "Shape onigiri carefully."
        You should still be able to tell one grain from another when tasting.

    ??? question "How do I shape the onigiri?"
        Palm a small amount of rice and make an indentation for the filling. Add the filling, and encase the filling with more rice. Shape it into a compact triangular form.
