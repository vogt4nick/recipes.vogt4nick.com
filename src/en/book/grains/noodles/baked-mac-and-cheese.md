---
=== "Ingredients"
    * 45 g Unsalted Butter
    * 3 T White Wheat Flour
    * 1 T Mustard Seed, ground
    * 1 t Paprika
    * 360 g Cream
    * 360 g Milk
    * 110 g Sharp Cheddar Cheese, shredded
    * 140 g Monterey Jack Cheese, shredded
    * 1/2 t Kosher Salt
    * 1/2 t Black Peppercorn, ground
    * 240 g Elbow Macaroni, cooked al dente, _do not rinse_
    * For topping
        * 80 g Monterey Jack Cheese, shredded
        * 45 g Unsalted Butter, melted
        * 120 g Breadcrumbs

=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare kitchen.** Heat oven to 350ºF (177ºC) and grease a baking dish.
    2. **Make roux.** Brown the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the roux is the texture of play-doh. Whisk in the mustard and paprika, and cook until aromatic, about another minute.
    3. **Make sauce.** Whisk in the milk, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, whisking often, until mixture is slightly thickened, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the cheese, remaining salt, and pepper.
    4. **Combine mac & cheese.** Fold in the macaroni and move to the prepared dish. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese, then toss the breadcrumbs with the melted butter and distribute evenly over the top.
    5. **Bake** 15-20 minutes until golden on top, but not dried out.
    6. **Cool** for 5 minutes before serving.
