    * 10 g Olive Oil

    * 1/2 t Kosher Salt

    !!! info "Cooked quinoa is 3x larger than dry quinoa."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Rinse** through a fine mesh strainer several times, and drain.
    2. **Toast.** Heat olive oil over medium-low heat. Stirring constantly, add quinoa and toast 4-6 minutes until golden and aromatic.
    3. **Cook.** Mix in water and salt, and bring to boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook 15 minutes until water is absorbed and kernels have popped. While covered, remove from heat and rest 5 minutes.
    4. **Fluff** quinoa with a fork.
    5. **Cool and serve.** Allow quinoa to cool, uncovered, for a few minutes before serving.

    !!! info "Rinsing the quinoa helps remove the saponin, its natural outer coating, which imparts a bitter taste.[^eggleston]"

    !!! tip "If there is a little bit of liquid in the bottom of the pan after simmering, you can remove from the heat but leave covered for 5 minutes for the remaining liquid to be absorbed.[^eggleston]"

    !!! tip "For faster preparation, you may skip the toasting step and add olive oil to the cooking liquid before cooking."
