=== "Directions"
    1. **Rinse** through a fine mesh strainer several times, and drain.
    2. **Toast** (optional). Heat olive oil over medium-low heat. Stirring constantly, add quinoa and toast 4-6 minutes until golden and aromatic.
    3. **Cook.** Mix in water and bring to boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook 15 minutes until water is absorbed and kernels have popped. While covered, remove from heat and rest 5 minutes.
    4. **Fluff** rice with a fork.
    5. **Cool and serve.** Allow quinoa to cool, uncovered, for a few minutes before serving.

    !!! tip "Rinsing thie quinoa helps remove the saponin, its natural outer coating, which imparts a bitter taste.[^eggleston]"

    !!! tip "If there is a little bit of liquid in the bottom of the pan after simmering, you can remove from the heat but leave covered for 5 minutes for the remaining liquid to be absorbed.[^eggleston]"
