!!! quote "Stephanie Li and Chris Thomas from _Chinese Cooking Demystified_.[^demystified]"
    Egg drop soup is less of a dish and more of a technique—pretty much any type of soup you got, you can drop in an egg.

## Ladling Method

Over low heat, ladle sheets of egg into the soup. "Imagine that your Jackson Pollock and you're going at a soup canvas."[^demystified] Using a spoon, evenly distribute the egg by gently pulling some of the larger sheets apart and over to the bubbling areas of the soup. Cook briefly until all sheets are floating. Remove from heat.

This technique gives you sheets of egg which separate from the final product.

## Stream & Stir Method

Remove soup from heat, and, stirring continuously, slowly pour egg in a thin stream.

This techinique gives one very fine strands of egg bits which incorporate into the final product.

## Whirlpool Method

Stir the soup rapidly. Pour egg into the stream of the whirlpool and spread against the current—if stirring in clockwise motion, pour the egg in counterclockwise. Gently stir and cook briefly until egg floats.

This technique results in longer, chunkier strands of egg.
