=== "Ingredients"
    * Dry Mix
        * 160 g All-Purpose Flour
        * 2 ml Baking Soda
        * 2 ml Kosher Salt
    * 110 g Unsalted Butter, room temperature, sliced into ribbons
    * 50 g White Sugar
    * 100 g Light Brown Sugar
    * 1 Egg, room temperature
    * 195 g Creamy Peanut Butter
    * 5 ml Vanilla Extract
    * 24 Chocolate Kiss Candies, unwrapped
    * For Coating
        * 100 g White Sugar

=== "Directions"
    1. **Combine dry mix.** Set aside.
    2. **Mix dough.** Whip butter for 60 seconds until creamy. Slowly add sugars while whipping until completely creamed and smooth. Mix in egg until combined. Mix in peanut butter and vanilla until combined. Slowly mix in the dry mix until just incorporated.
    4. **Chill dough** 30 minutes.
    5. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (177°C).
    6. **Shape and decorate.** Scoop and shape 15 g dough balls. Coat balls in sugar. Arrange on a parchment-lined sheetpan.
    7. **Bake** 10 minutes at 350°F until the tops begin to slighly crack. Remove from heat.
    8. **Cool** 10 minutes at room temperature.
    9. **Add kisses.** Press chocolate kiss candy into each cookie until it sticks.
    10. **Freeze cookies** 10 minutes to prevent melting.

    ??? tip "If chilling for longer than a few hours..."
        Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard and the cookies may not spread much.
