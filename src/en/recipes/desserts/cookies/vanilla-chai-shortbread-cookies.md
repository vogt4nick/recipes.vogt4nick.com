        * 240 ml Unsalted Butter
        * 60 g Powdered Sugar
        * 250 g All-Purpose Flour
        * 3 ml Kosher Salt
        * 25 ml Vanilla Chai Tea, loose leaf
    * Icing

=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix dough.** Mix butter and sugar in a large bowl until aerated cream forms. Add remaining batter ingredients. Mix until a cohesive, soft, tender dough forms.
    2. **Chill dough.** Transfer dough to plastic wrap. Wrap and twist to seal such that the dough forms a cylinder about 5 cm in diameter. Chill 20 minutes in freezer or 40 minutes in refrigerator.
    3. **Preheat oven** to 350ºF (177ºC).
    4. **Shape cookies.** Remove dough from plastic wrap. Cut dough cylinder into 1 cm slices.
    5. **Bake cookies.** Transfer cookies to a parchment-lined sheetpan. Bake 18-20 minutes at 350ºF until edges are golden brown.
    6. **Cool** 30 minutes on a wire rack until cooled completely.
    7. **Whisk icing** ingredients together until smooth.
    8. **Ice cookies.** Dip cookies in icing halfway. Allow excess icing to drip away, and transfer to parchment or wax paper to set.
