If you don’t have the cheese rind you can substitute 1/4 cup grated cheese. Lore says that Italian wedding soup began as a dish traditionally served to the bride and groom at wedding receptions to help them, with strength and vigor, through the wedding night but historians disagree. The former is apparently not true.  It gained its name from the harmony of its ingredients. In English “wedding soup” actually means “married soup” (minestra maritata) in Italian. This has led to the misunderstanding of how the dish came by its name.  Darn!
