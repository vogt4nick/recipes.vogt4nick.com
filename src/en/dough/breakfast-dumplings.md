=== "Directions"
    1. **Soak the bread cubes** in milk at room temperature for at least 5 minutes.
    2. **Heat the vegetable broth.**
    3. **Sweat onion** and garlic in butter until soft.
    4. **Combine ingredients.** Mix soaked bread cubes, sautéed onions, cheese, egg, and seasonings together in a large bowl to form a rather soft mass.
    5. **Rest.** Let the mixture rest at least 30 minutes at room temperature.
    6. **Shape the dumplings.** With damp hands, form six, gently pressed dumplings --- if it starts to fall apart, you're pressing too hard!
    7. **Fry the dumplings.** Heat the oil in a frying over medium-high heat. Fry 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove from heat.
    8. **Serve** in vegetable broth in a shallow bowl --- the dumplings must not be fully submerged.
