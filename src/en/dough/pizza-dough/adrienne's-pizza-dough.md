=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix dough.** Add water, salt to large (>5L) dough tub. Stir until dissolved. Add yeast. Rest 60 seconds. Mix until dissolved. Add flour. Stir until dough ball forms.
    2. **Knead & rest.** Cut and fold the dough a few times using [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s). Verify dough temperature is about 80ºF (27ºC). Rest 20 minutes.
    3. **Knead & rise.** Transfer to a lightly-floured work surface. Knead 60 seconds until the skin of the dough is very smooth. Return dough ball seam-side down to the original, lightly-oiled dough tub. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Rest dough 2 hours between 70ºF-74ºF (21ºC-23ºC).
    4. **Shape dough.** Dividing as necessary: Transfer dough to floured surface at least 60 cm wide. Dust top of dough with flour. Use scale to divide dough (again) into 3 equal pieces. Gently shape dough pieces into medium-tight balls.
    5. **Ferment dough.** Arrange dough balls on lightly floured plate(s) with enough room to expand. Lightly flour top of dough balls. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use, no more than 48 hours.
