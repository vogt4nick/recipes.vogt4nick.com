    * 15 g Lemon Juice or Wine Vinegar, room temperature
    * 1/2 t Kosher Salt
    * 1/4 t Dijon Mustard
    * For Emulsion
        * 400 g Extra Virgin Olive Oil, room temperature

        * 1 T Lemon Juice or Wine Vinegar, room temperature
        * 1/4 t Dijon Mustard
        * 1/8 t Kosher Salt
        * 1/8 t Black Peppercorn, ground

=== "Directions"
    1. **Beat eggs.** Add egg yolks to a warm mixing bowl. Whisk 2 minutes until eggs are thick and sticky. Add lemon juice, salt, and mustard. Whisk 30 seconds.
    2. **Emulsify mixture.** In teaspoon increments, add oil to mixture and whisk until sauce has thickened before adding more oil. After about 90 g oil has been incorporated, the sauce will thicken into a very heavy cream. In 20 g increments, add oil to mixture and whisk until sauce has thickened before adding more oil. Add boiling water to prevent curdling.
    3. **Season mayonnaise** to taste.
