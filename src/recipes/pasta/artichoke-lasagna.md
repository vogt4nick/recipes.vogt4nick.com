=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oven** to 400F (205C).
    2. **Saute artichokes.** Add butter, artichoke hearts, salt to unheated frying pan. Add water enough to cover the artichokes. Heat to medium. Simmer gently until all water has evaporated and artichokes are lightly browned and fork tender. Remove from heat. Combine with bechamel sauce. Set aside as *creamy artichoke hearts*.
    4. **Layer lasagna.** Grease dish with butter and some bechamel sauce. Build 6+ layers of pasta, creamy artichoke hearts, and parmesan. Top with remaining bechamel sauce. Dot with butter. Garnish with remaining parmesan.
    5. **Bake** 12 minutes until a light, golden crust forms on top. Remove from oven.
    6. **Cool** 10 minutes at room temperature.
    7. **Serve** with grated parmesan.

    ??? question "I don't see a crust forming"
        If after the first few minutes you don't see any sign of a crust beginning to form, increase the oven temperature to 450F (220C). Bake no longer than 15 minutes altogether.
