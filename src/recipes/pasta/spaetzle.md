title: Spätzle
---

???+ quote "Chef John from FoodWishes.com"
    One way you can tell [the] texture was perfect: the batter won't drip through until you push it with the spatula. ...if it drips before you push, add some flour so you don't have mush.

=== "Ingredients"
    * 333 g All Purpose Flour
    * 4 Eggs
    * 133 ml Milk
    * 15 ml Butter, unsalted
    * 5 ml Kosher Salt

=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix batter.** Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl. Mix 10 minutes until thick, either by hand or with a stand mixer.
    2. **Boil spätzle.** Bring a stockpot of salt water to the simmer. Dividing as necessary, push the batter through a sieve and into the simmering pot to form the spätzle (see note). The spätzle are done when they float to the top. Skim the spätzle from the top and set aside to dry slightly.

    ??? question "What kind of sieve do I need?"
        You can use a colander with large holes (like us) or you can use the back of a cheese grater like Chef John (see [video clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lwn97mpBCu8&t=1m57s))
