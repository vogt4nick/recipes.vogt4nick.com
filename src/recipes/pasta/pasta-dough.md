=== "Ingredients"
    * 2 Eggs
    * 125 g All Purpose Flour

=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare mix.** Pour the flour onto a work surface, shape it into a mound, and scoop out a deep hollow in its center. Break the eggs into the hollow.
    2. **Mix dough.** Beat the eggs lightly with a fork for about 60 seconds as though you were making an omelet. Draw some of the flour over the eggs, mixing it in with the fork a little at a time, until the eggs are no longer runny. Draw the sides of the mound together with your hands, but push some of the flour to one side, keeping it out of the way until you absolutely need it. Work the eggs and flour together, using your fingers and the palms of your hands, until you have a smoothly integrated mixture. If it is still moist, work in more flour.
    3. **Test dough.** Press your thumb deep into the center of the mass. if it comes out clean, without any sticky matter on it, no more flour is needed.
    4. **Clean surface.** Scrape debris from work surface before kneading.
    5. **Knead dough.** Return to the mass of flour and eggs. Push forward against it using th heel of you palm, keeping your fingers bent. Fold the mass in half, give it a half turn, press hard against it with the heel of your palm again, and repeat the operation. Make sure that you keep turning the ball of dough always in the same direction. When you have kneaded it thus for 8 full minutes and the dough is as smooth as baby skin, it is ready for the machine.
    6. **Divide dough.** Cut each ball of dough made with 2 eggs into 6 equal parts. In other words, the pieces of dough you end up with for thinning should be three times as many as the eggs you used.
    7. **Prepare drying place.** Spread clean, dry, cloth dish towels over a work counter near where you'll be using the machine. If you are making a lot of pasta you'll need a lot of counter space and a lot of towels.
    8. **Roll pasta.** Set the pair of smooth cylinders, the thinning rollers, at their widest opening. Flatten one of the pieces of dough by pummeling it with your palm, and run it through the machine. Fold the dough twice into a third of its length, and feed it by its narrow ened through the machine once again. Repeat the operation 2-3 times, then lay the flattened strip of pasta over a towel on the counter.
    9. **Cook pasta** in boiling, lightly salted water for 2-3 minutes.
