=== "Directions"
    1. **Beat eggs.** Add egg yolks to a warm mixing bowl. Whisk 2 minutes until eggs are thick and sticky. Add lemon juice, salt, and mustard. Whisk 30 seconds.
    2. **Emulsify mixture.** In 5 ml increments, add oil to mixture and whisk until sauce has thickened before adding more oil. After 100 ml oil has been incorporated, the sauce will thicken into a very heavy cream. In 20 ml increments, add oil to mixture and whisk until sauce has thickened before adding more oil. Add boiling water to prevent curdling.
    3. **Season mayonnaise** to taste.
