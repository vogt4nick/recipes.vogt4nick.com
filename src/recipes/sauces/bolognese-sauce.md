??? note "Notes from Marcella"
    * The meat should not be from too lean a cut; the more marbled it is, the sweeter the sauce will be. The neck portion of the chuck works well.
    * Add salt immediately when sauteing the meat to extract its juices for the subsequent benefit of the sauce.
    * Cook the meat in milk before adding wine and tomatoes to protect it from the acidic bite of the latter.
    * Do not use a demiglace or other concentrates that tip the balance of flavors toward harshness.
    * Use a pot that retains heat. Earthenware is preferred in Bologna and bot most cooks in Emilia-Romagna, but enameled cast-iron pans or a pot whose heavy bottom is composed of layers of steel allows are fully satisfactory.
    * Cook, uncovered, at the merest simmer for a long, long time; no less than 3 hours is necessary. More is better.
