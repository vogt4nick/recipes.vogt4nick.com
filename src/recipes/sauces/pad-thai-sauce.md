???+ quote "Chez Pim"
    [Sauce should] lead with a salty flavor, follow by a mild sourness, then just a gentle sweetness and a soft caress from the chili at the back of my throat at the very end.

=== "Ingredients"
    | Amount | Ingredient     |
    | :----- | :------------- |
    | 60 ml  | Tamarind Pulp* |
    | 60 ml  | Fish Sauce**   |

    ??? question "Substitutions"
