    ??? question "Do I need to peel the vegetables?"
        No. All solids will be filtered from the stock before its done.

=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare stock base.** Add flesh and bones to stockpot. Add water, enough to cover by 5 cm. Simmer over medium heat. Skim scum from surface. Add remaining mirepoix and seasoning. Stir to combine.
    2. **Check water level.** The liquid should cover the ingredients by 2.5 cm. Add water if necessary. When liquid is simmering again, skim as necessary.
    3. **Simmer stock.** Partially cover stockpan. Simmer 4 hours or more, skimming accumulated scum occasionally.
    4. **Strain stock** through a fine colander to remove all solids.
    5. **Degrease stock.** Chill stock in refrigerator until fats have hardened on the surface. Degrease solids.

    ??? question "When can I stop skimming scum?"
        After about 5 minutes the scum should stop accumulating.

    ??? question "What if the liquid evaporates below the level of the ingredients?"
        Add boiling water to cover by 2.5 cm.

    !!! question "How can I make the stock stronger?"
        Simmer stock after degreasing to evaporate some of its water and to concentrate its strength.

    ??? tip "Never allow the liquid to boil."
        The fat and scum incorporate themselves into the stock and will make it cloudy.

    !!! tip "Cooking may be stopped at any time and continued later."

!!! tip "Preserve stock by reducing and freezing cubes in ice tray."
