=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare materials.** Preheat oven to 450F (230C). Prepare a foiled sheetpan.
    2. **Boil potatoes.** Add potatoes, salt, baking soda, and water (enough to cover the mixture) to stockpan. Stir. Boil 6 minutes until nearly cooked-through. Strain**.
    3. **Dry potatoes.** Rest potatoes 15 minutes until done steaming.
    4. **Season potatoes** with spices and oil.
    5. **Roast potatoes.** Move to prepared sheetpan. Spread evenly so no potatoes are touching. Roast 50 minutes at 450F, turning every 20 minutes.
    6. **Serve** with sour cream for dipping.

    ??? warning "Do not drain in a fine mesh colander."
        We want to keep the dry, starchy outsides of the potatoes. These will crisp and help the texture. A fine colander will grate these off.
