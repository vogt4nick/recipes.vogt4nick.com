=== "Ingredients"
    * 500 g Russet Potatoes, peeled, roughly chopped, parboiled
    * 160 ml All-Purpose Flour
    * 2 ml Salt
    * 1 ml Nutmeg, ground (optional)
    * 1 Egg, beaten

=== "Directions"
    1. **Rice potatoes.** Press potatoes through ricer. Set aside for 30 minutes to cool, stirring occasionally.
    2. **Form dumplings.** Add remaining ingredients. Mix loosely with hands. Knead the dough quickly with your hands. Form mandarin size dumplings.
    3. **Cook dumplings.** Heat *salt water* to a gentle boil. Cook dumplings 8 minutes until they float to the top. Remove from water.

    ??? tip "Use a wide stockpan."
        Dumplings need space to float in the pot that is why you need a wide pot rather than a tall pot.
