=== "Directions"
    1. **Saute pulled pork** in a nonstick frying pan until warm and somewhat crispy. Remove from heat, reserving drippings in frying pan, and set aside.
    2. **Prepare spätzle** for transfer directly from the boiling water into the frying pan.
    3. **Saute pepper spätzle.** Add half the spätzle to the frying pan. Season generously with black pepper. Saute 3 minutes, stirring as necessary to prevent sticking, until the spätzle separate. Set aside.
