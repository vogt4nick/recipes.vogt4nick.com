=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oil.** Heat 6 cm canola oil to 375°F (190°C) in a large stockpan over medium-high heat.
    2. **Prepare dough.** Add flour and salt to food processor. Pulse evenly. Add butter bits. Chop until combined. Add yogurt. Pulse 10 times. Pulse, adding cold water 15 ml at a time through the feed tube, until dough forms a ball. Remove dough from food processor. Knead 60 seconds by hand. Cover with damp towel and set aside.
    3. **Make filling.** Melt butter in frying pan over medium heat. Add onions and chiles. Stir. Cook 5 minutes, stirring every 60 seconds. Add remaining spices. Stir. Cook 2 minutes. Increase frying pan to medium-high heat. Add *parboiled potatoes* and peas. Cook 10 minutes, stirring every 60 seconds, until potatoes begin to brown. Remove from heat. Set aside as *samosa filling.*
    4. **Form samosas.** Prepare a lightly floured surface. Knead dough briefly by hand. Dividing as necessary, roll circular pockets 4 mm thick x 10 cm in diameter. Add 15 ml filling to each samosa. Fold, crimp, and seal with a few drops of water as needed.
    5. **Fry\*\*\* samosas.** Prepare flat surface with paper bags or paper towels. Fry samosas 4 minutes until golden brown. Drain on prepared surface. Keep warm in oven until ready to serve.

    ??? tip "Try baked samosas"
        For less mess, bake samosas at 350°F (177°C) for 25 minutes until golden brown.
