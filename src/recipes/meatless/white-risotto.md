???+ quote "Marcella Hazan in *Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking*"
    You must never stop stirrig and you must be sure to wipe the bottom of the pot completely clean frequently, or the rice will stick to it.

=== "Ingredients"
    * 1200 ml [Vegetable Stock](../soups/stocks/vegetable-stock.md), simmering
    * 15 ml Unsalted Butter
    * 30 ml Vegetable Oil
    * 30 g Onion, minced
    * 400 g Arborio Rice, unrinsed
    * Garnish
        * 30 ml Unsalted Butter
        * 80 g Parmesan Cheese, grated
        * 15 g White Truffle, shaved (optional)

=== "Directions"
    1. **Parfry onion base.** Add butter, oil, and onion to a room temperature, heavy bottomed stockpan. Place over medium-high heat. Cook 8 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes, until translucent. Add rice. Coat evenly.
    2. **Cook risotto.** Maintain medium-high heat. Dividing stock into 120 ml increments: Add stock to pan and stir continuously until all the liquid is gone; continue when there is no more liquid in the pot. Gradually reduce the volume of liquid added after 20 minutes as the rice approaches a tender and firm texture.
    3. **Garnish.** Add butter and parmesan. Cook another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously. Garnish with truffles after plating.


!!! tip "Plate on a platter to steam off any extra liquid before serving."
