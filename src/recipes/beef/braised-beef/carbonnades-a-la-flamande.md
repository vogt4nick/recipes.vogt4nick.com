=== "Directions"
    1. **Brown beef.** Heat lard over high heat in skillet until almost smoking. Dividing as necessary, brown the beef slices. Set aside.
    2. **Sweat onions.** Reduce to medium heat. Stir in onions to coat evenly in drippings, adding additional lard if necessary. Sweat 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and onions appear brown from the deglazed pan. Remove from heat. Stir in salt, pepper, garlic.
    3. **Layer beef and onions.** Arrange half the browned beef in a stockpot. Lightly season with salt, pepper. Spread half the onions over the beef. Repeat with remaining browned beef and onions. Deglaze and scrape up any remaining juices in the frying pan with some stock. Add stock and juices to stockpot. Add enough beer so the meat is not quite covered. Stir in brown sugar. Submerge herb bouquet.
    4. **Braise**, partially covered, 2.5 hours at a very low simmer until meat is fork tender. Remove herb bouquet.
    5. **Thicken sauce.** Drain cooking liquid into a saucepan. Skim fat. Whisk in vinegar slurry. Simmer 3-4 minutes. Carefully (!) correct seasoning as desired.
    6. **Garnish** with parsley and serve.

    ???+ quote "Julia Child in _Mastering the Art of French Cooking_[^1]"
        Dry the beef in paper towels; it will not brown if it is damp.

    !!! tip "Pack herbs in a tea infuser if you don't have twine for an herb bouquet."

    ???+ quote "Gordon Ramsay in "Winter Beef Recipes To Keep You Warm"[^2]"
        The secret of braising is having little of the meat exposed and 90% of it submerged... They're like little crocodile heads popping up out of the water... Leave the lid [uncovered]... If we had to cover it completely, steam hits the top of the lid and all the water comes running back [on top of the exposed meat].

!!! note "Serve with mashed potatoes or buttered noodles."
