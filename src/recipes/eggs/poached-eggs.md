=== "Ingredients"
    * Eggs
    * Water
    * 15 ml White Vinegar

=== "Directions"
    1. **Simmer water** and vinegar in a saucepan. Maintain a bare simmer for the duration of the operation.
    2. **Poach eggs.** Break the egg, hold it as closely over the water as possible, and let it fall in. Immediately and gently push the white over the yolk with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 seconds. Poach 4 minutes.
    3. **Shock egg.** Gently transfer egg to cold water.

    ??? question "Why shock the poached egg in cold water?"
        Two reasons:

        1. The cold water stops the cooking process.
        2. The cold water rinses any lingering vinegar clinging to the poached egg.

    ??? question "How do I prepare poached eggs ahead of time?"
        Poached eggs can remain for several hours in cold water. They can also be drained and refrigerated, but I don't recommend it if you can avoid it.

    ??? question "How do I reheat a poached egg?"
        Trim off any trailing bits of white with knife. Place them in hot salted water for 30 seconds to hea them through. Remove with a slotted spoon. Holding a folded towel under the spoon, roll the egg back and forth to drain it, and it is ready to serve.
