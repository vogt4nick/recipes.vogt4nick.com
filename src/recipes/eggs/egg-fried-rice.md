    !!! question "Substitute white wine, stock, or water for rice wine."

    ??? tip "The key to great fried rice is leftover white rice."
        We cook a batch of rice before bed and let it sit in the rice cooker overnight to really dry it out. In the morning we chill it, so it's perfect for fried rice in the evening.

=== "Directions"
    1. **Fry vegetables**. Heat oil in a wok over high heat. Add carrots, peppers, and seasonings. Fry 5 minutes, stirring continuously, until they start to brown. Add peas. Fry 60 seconds, stirring continuously. Remove vegetables from wok, reserving oil in wok. Set aside.
    2. **Fry rice**. Maintain high heat. Add garlic and ginger. Fry 30 seconds. Dividing as necessary, add rice; breaking up clumps and stirring into the oil as necessary. Make a well in the center, and break egg into center. Stir egg until it is somewhat scrambled. Stir to combine rice and egg.
    3. **Combine ingredients**. Stir fried vegetables back to wok. Add rice wine. Cook 60 seconds, stirring continuously. Remove from heat. Add remaining sauces. Stir to combine.
    4. **Garnish & serve** with scallions.
