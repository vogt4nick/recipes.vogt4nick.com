    Pad thai has to cook *fast*, and it can't cook fast if you're still crushing peanuts and slicing limes.

=== "Ingredients"
    * 150 ml [Pad Thai Sauce](../sauces/pad-thai-sauce.md)
    * 80 g Rice Sticks
    * 60 ml Canola Oil
    * 60 g Chicken Breast, chopped
    * 5 ml Garlic, chopped (optional)
    * 1 Egg
    * 15 g Peanuts, roughly ground
    * 15 g Beansprouts
    * 15 g Pickled Turnips, chopped (optional)
    * 30 ml Garlic Chives, roughly chopped
    * Lime, sliced

    ??? question "Substitutions"
        Substitute green parts of scallions for garlic chives.

=== "Directions"
    1. **Warm sauce.** Simmer pad thai sauce over low heat.
