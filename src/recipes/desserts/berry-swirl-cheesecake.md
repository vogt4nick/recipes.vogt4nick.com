=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare materials.** Heat oven to 350F (180C). Wrap exterior of a 9-inch springform pan (including base) tightly in a triple layer of foil; set aside.
    2. **Pre-bake crust.** Add crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt to a medium bowl. Mix. Press crumb mixture firmly into bottom of pan and up the sides to about 25 mm (1") from the top of the pan. Bake 10 minutes at 350F until set. Cool in pan on cooling rack. Set aside as *prepared crust*.
    3. **Reduce heat.** Reduce oven to 325 degrees.
    4. **Puree berries.** Add berries and sugar to food processor. Puree until smooth. Sieve seeds from mixture. Add berry puree to piping bag. Set aside as *berry puree*.
    5. **Mix filling.** Add cream cheese to large bowl. Mix at medium speed with paddle 3 minutes until fluffy. Mix at low speed while adding remaining sugar in a slow, steady stream. Add salt and vanilla. Mix. Add eggs and mix, one at a time.
    6. **Form cheesecake.** Pour cream cheese filling over crust. Add small droplets of *berry puree* over top of cake. Swirl the sauce and filling decoratively with a toothpick. Set cake pan inside a large, shallow roasting pan. Add boiling water to roasting pan until water level is halfway up the sides of the cake pan.
    7. **Bake cheesecake.** Bake 60 minutes until cake is set but still slightly wobbly in center (a toothpick inserted near the center should not have wet, thin batter on it when removed).

    9. **Serve.** Run a knife around edge of cake. Unmold cake. Serve.
