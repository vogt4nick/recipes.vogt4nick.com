=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix filling.** Whisk tapioca syrup. Combine filling ingredients. Mix tapioca-syrup into pear mixture until thoroughly combined.
    2. **Chill filling.** Cover mixture with plastic wrap or transfer to airtight container. Chill at least 3 days and up to one year.
    3. **Build pie.** Cast sugar-flour into the bottom of crust. Fill crust with aged pear mixture. Dot the mixture with sugar cubes. Place the lid on top. Crimp.
    4. **Chill pie** 15 minutes in freezer.
    5. **Preheat oven** to 450°F (232°C).
    6. **Decorate pie.** Brush the top and crimped edge with egg wash. Use a paring knife to cut steam vents in your chosen design.
    7. **Bake.** Transfer pie to a parchment-lined sheetpan. Bake 15 - 20 minutes at 450°F until the crust is evenly golden brown. Reduce heat to 325°F (163°C), and continue baking 50 - 70 minutes until the pie juices are bubbling in the center.
    8. **Cool** 4 - 6 hours on a wire rack until room temperature.

    ??? quote "Lisa Ludwinski on crimping crust:[^1]"
        > Roll the dough overhang of the bottom crust toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, as though you were rolling a poster tightly. Roll the dough with one thumb while the other thumb presses the dough down into the tin's edge to seal. Then form a "C" with the thumb and index finger of one hand and use those fingers to pinch and lift the rim of the dough up and away from the pan, simultaneously pressing the thumb of your other hand into the "C" to make a crimp.
