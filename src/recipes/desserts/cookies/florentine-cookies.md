=== "Ingredients"
    * Dry Mix
        * 40 g Pistachios, toasted
        * 60 g Dried Sour Cherries
        * 60 g Candied Ginger[^3]
        * 20 g All Purpose Flour
        * 30 g Coconut Flakes
        * 120 g Almonds, sliced
    * 70 g Unsalted Butter
    * 120 g Light Muscovado Sugar
    * 3 ml Kosher Salt
    * 30 ml Double Cream
    * For Decoration
        * 125 g 54% Dark Chocolate, finely chopped
        * 25 g White Chocolate, finely chopped

=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oven** to 390 F (200 C).
    2. **Blitz dry mix.** Add pistachios, cherries, and candied ginger to a food processor. Blitz 5 seconds until it resembles a small rubble. Add flour. Blitz again to combine. Transfer dry mix to bowl. Mix in coconut and almonds.
    3. **Caramelize sugar.** Combine butter, sugar, and salt together in a saucepan on low heat. Cook with minimal stirring until the mixture is 120 C (250 F). Remove from heat. Stir in cream until combined.
    4. **Mix batter.** Stir caramelized sugar and dry mix together until well mixed.
    5. **Shape cookies.** Arrange 5 cm (2-inch) cookie cutter on a parchment-lined sheetpan. Pour 15 ml of batter into the cookie cutter and shape into an even thickness. Remove cutter. Repeat until you have 6 circles of mixture, allowing plenty of remove between each for the mixture to spread during baking.
    6. **Bake** 8-10 minutes at 390 F until golden brown. Remove from heat, and push the edges of the biscuit into a neat, round shape while the cookie is still hot.
    7. **Cool** 5 minutes before transfering to a wire rack to cool completely.
    8. **Melt chocolate.** Gently melt dark chocolate and white chocolate separately over double boilers.
    9. **Decorate.** Dip the base of each florentine into the dark chocolate. Transfer to a wire rack -- chocolate side up -- to cool. Once set, drizzle white chocolate over the dark chocolate. Continue cooling to set before serving.

    !!! caution "Watch the bake carefully!"
        If the Florentines are pale in the centre, they will be soft and chewy. If they are over-browned, they will be too brittle.
