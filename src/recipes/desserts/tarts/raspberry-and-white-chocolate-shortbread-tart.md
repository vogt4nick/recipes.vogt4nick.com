=== "Directions"
    1. **Setup.** Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a 9-inch removable-bottom tart pan and place this on a baking sheet.
    2. **Mix dough.** Add butter, sugar, vanilla, brown sugar to mixing bowl. Mix vigorously 3 minutes until pale and fluffy. While mixing, slowly add flour and salt until blended. Divide batter into 450 g and 225 g parts.
    3. **Layer tart.** Add 450 g dough to the prepared tart pan, and press evenly into the pan (including the sides). Add raspberry preserves. Add berries. Crumble the remaining dough into large crumbs and scatter evenly over the filling, covering most of the surface.

    5. **Garnish** with the white chocolate chips.
    6. **Cool** 30 minutes before serving.
