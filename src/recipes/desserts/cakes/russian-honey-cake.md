=== "Directions"
    1. **Chill utentils.** Chill mixing bowl and whisk before using.
    2. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).
    3. **Burn honey** 10 minutes in saucepan over medium heat until somewhat darker and caramel-like in aroma. Remove from heat. Whisk in cold water.
    4. **Mix batter.** Heat a large metal bowl over very low heat. Add butter, sugar, honey, and 80 g burnt honey. Heat 5-7 minutes until butter melts. Whisk briefly, and continue heating until very warm to the touch. Whisk in eggs. Continue heating until very warm again. Whisk baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Whisk into heated mixture. Remove from heat. Dividing as necessary, sift in flour until batter is easily spreadable.
    5. **Bake layers.** Transfer 120 ml batter onto parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread into a 22 cm (9-inch) circle. Shake and tap the pan to knock out any air bubbles. Bake 6-7 minutes at 375°F until lightly browned. Remove from heat and cool 6-7 minutes until firm enough to remove. Invert cake onto a round of parchment paper. Repeat until you have 8 layers, allowing each to cool on an individual parchment round.
    6. **Bake crumb mixture.** Trim cake edges to ensure they are the same size, reserving scraps for crumb mixture. Spread remaining batter onto a parchment-lined sheetpan. Bake 10 minutes at 375°F until edges are dry. Remove from heat and cut into small pieces. Add all scraps to sheetpan. Bake 7-10 minutes at 375°F until browned. Remove from heat, and cool 15-20 minutes until room temperature. Transfer to a plastic bag and beat into fairly fine crumbs using a rolling pin. Set aside.
    7. **Whip frosting.** Remove the bowl and whisk from the refrigerator. Whisk heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add sour cream and remaining burnt honey. Continue whisking until stiff peaks form.
    8. **Layer cake.** Place a cake layer on a parchment paper round on top of a serving plate. Spread a cup of frosting evenly on top, almost to the edge. Repeat with cake layers and frosting, pressing the layers in smooth-side down. Place last cake layer smooth-side up. Frost the top and sides of the cake. Cover with crumbs; clean any excess crumbs around base.
    9. **Chill** at least 8 hours, covered.
