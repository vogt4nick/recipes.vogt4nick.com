=== "Ingredients"
    * 140 g All-Purpose Flour
    * 120 ml Butter, unsalted, cold, divided by 15 ml
    * 5 ml White Sugar
    * 3 ml Kosher Salt
    * 45 ml Ice Water

    !!! tip "Omit sugar for a savory piecrust ideal in quiche and tarts."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix dough.** Add flour, sugar, salt to food processor. Pulse twice. Add butter. Blend 10 seconds until mixture looks like cornmeal and the butter and flour are mixed. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Mix in ice water.
    2. **Chill once.** Shape dough into a ball. Wrap in plastic. Chill 20 minutes in refrigerator.
    3. **Roll out dough.** Transfer chilled dough ball to a floured work surface. Lightly flour the dough ball. Use a rolling pin to roll with light pressure from the center out. Roll. Add flour, rotate, and turn the dough as needed. Stop when the diameter of the dough is about 5 cm greater than the diameter of your pie plate. Drape the dough over the rolling pin to transfer it into the pie plate. Press dough firmly into the plate all over.
    4. **Chill twice.** Chill 60 minutes in refrigerator.
    5. **Dress pie crust.** Trim the excess dough to about 15 mm all around, then tuck it under itself around the edge of the plate. Decorate the edges with a fork or your fingers.
    6. **Chill thrice.** Chill 20 minutes in refrigerator.

    ??? question "Why don't we add water while the dough is in the food processor?"
        Two reasons:

        1. The dough is going to get super thick when we add water. It can burn out the motor.
        2. The food processor can overwork the dough at this point.

    ??? question "What does it mean to 'overwork' the dough?"
        The pockets of butter make the piecrust flaky. To overwork the dough is to make these pockets smaller and smaller. You won't have a delicate, flaky crust; it will come out tough and mealy.

    ??? question "Can I chill the dough faster in the freezer?"
        Yes. You can chill the dough ball in freezer in half the time; e.g. 20 minutes in the refrigerator requires 10 minutes in the freezer.

    ??? question "What if the dough is too sticky to roll?"
        Add a little flour. Chill the dough again if it continues to become sticky, and it's taking you more than a few minutes to roll it out.

    ??? question "What if my dough tears while rolling?"
        Use ragged edges of dough to repair tears. Add a drop of water when you press the patch into place.
