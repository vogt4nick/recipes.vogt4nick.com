=== "Ingredients"
    * 320 g All-Purpose Flour
    * 5 ml White Sugar
    * 5 ml Kosher Salt
    * 220 g Butter, unsalted, chilled, divided into 5 g chunks
    * 120 ml Water, cold (0-5 C)

    !!! tip "Choose a butter with high butterfat percentage, e.g. Plugr√°."

=== "Directions"
    1. **Blend.** Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Add butter and coat in flour. Blend with pastry blender until until the largest pieces are the size and shape of peas. Add water all at once. Toss dough back and forth until no pools of water remain. Repeatedly compress the dough into the remaining dry ingredients until fully incorporated.
    2. **Divide.** Transfer dough to a floured surface and cut into two equal portions.
    3. **Shape pie crust.** Take one portion. Shape dough into a 5 cm tall disc. Seal any broken edges. Wrap them tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap.
    4. **Shape lattice top.** Take the remaining portion. Shape dough into a 15 x 8 cm rectangle.
    5. **Chill** 60 minutes in fridge before use or blind bake.

    ??? question "What does it mean to 'overwork' the dough?"
        The pockets of butter make the pie crust flaky. To overwork the dough is to make these pockets smaller and smaller. You won't have a delicate, flaky crust; it will come out tough and mealy.

    ??? question "Can I chill the dough faster in the freezer?"
        Yes. You can chill the dough ball in freezer in half the time; e.g. 20 minutes in the refrigerator requires 10 minutes in the freezer.

    ??? question "What if the dough is too sticky to roll?"
        Add a little flour. Chill the dough again if it continues to become sticky, and it's taking you more than a few minutes to roll it out.

    ??? question "What if my dough tears while rolling?"
        Use ragged edges of dough to repair tears. Add a drop of water when you press the patch into place.


=== "Blind Bake Directions"
    1. **Prepare pie crust** following the relevant directions. The pie crust must be chilled before baking.
    2. **Preheat oven** to 425 F (220 C).
    3. **Weigh down pie crust.** Press pie crust firmly into the pie plate. Lightly grease one side a large sheet of foil with butter. Press the foil onto the crust butter-side down. Pour some dry rice or beans into the foil.
    4. **Bake at 425F** for 12 minutes. Remove from oven. Remove weights and foil.
    5. **Bake at 350F**. Reduce oven to 350 F (175 C). Bake 10 minutes until the crust turns golden brown color.
    6. **Cool to room-temperature** on a wire rack before filling.

    !!! info "Continue baking until crust is golden brown if the pie's filling requires no additional baking."

    ??? question "Why do we weigh down the pie crust?"
        The pie crust can bubble and lose its shape while baking. Weighing it down helps safeguard a crust that looks as good as it tastes.

=== "Lisa's Directions"
    Paraphrased from Lisa's directions in *Sister Pie*[^2]

    1. In a large stainless steel bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt and stir to mix well. Place the sticks of butter in the bowl and coat on all sides with the flour mixture. Using a bench scraper, cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes. Work quickly to separate the cubes with your hands until the are all lightly coated in flour. Grab that bench scraper once again and cut each cube in half. I always tell my pie dough students that it's unnecessary to actually cut each cube perfectly in half, but it's a good idea to break up the butter enough so that you can be super-efficient when it's pastry blender time.
    2. It's pastry blender time! Switch to the pastry blender and begin to cut in the butter with one hand while turning the bowl with the other. It's important not to aim for the same spot at the bottom of the bowl with each stroke of the pastry blender, but to actually slice through butter every time to maximize efficiency. When the pastry blender clogs up, carefully clean it out with your fingers. Continue to blend and turn until the largest pieces are size and shape of peas and the rest of the mixture looks freakishly similar to canned Parmesan cheese.
    3. At this point, add the [water] all at once. Use a bench scraper or rubber spatula to scrape as much of the mixture as you can from one side of the bowl to the other, until you can't see visible pools of liquid anymore. Using your hands, scoop up as much of the mixture as you can, and use the tips of your fingers (and a whole lot of pressure) to press it back down onto the rest of the ingredients. Rotate the bowl a quarter-turn and repeat. Scoop, press, turn. With each fold, your intention is to be quickly forming the mixture into a cohesive mass. Remember to incorporate any dry, floury bits that have congregated at the bottom of the bowl, and once those are completely gone and the dough is formed, it's time to stop.
    4. Remove the dough form the bowl, place it on a lightly floured counter, and use your bench scraper to divide it into two equal pieces. Gently pat each into a 2-inch-thick disc, working quickly to seal any broken edges before wrapping them tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap. If you're portioning for a lattice-topped pie, shape one half into a 2-inch-thick disc and the other half into a 6 by 3-inch rectangle. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours or, ideally, overnight. When you got to roll out the crust, you want the discs to feel as hard and cold as the butter did when you removed it from the fridge to make the dough. This will make the roll-out way easier.
    5. You can keep the pie dough in the fridge for a few days or in the freezer for up to 1 year. If frozen, remove the dough and place it in the refrigerator to thaw one full day before you intend to use it. If you're planning to make only one single-crust pie, wrap the discs separately and place one in the freezer.

!!! note "Yields two 9-inch single-crust pie crusts."
