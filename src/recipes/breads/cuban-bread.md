=== "Ingredients"
    * Starter
        *  120 ml Water, warm
        *  60 g Flour
        *  3 ml Active Dry Yeast
    * 12 ml Active Dry Yeast
    * 10 ml White Sugar
    * 180 ml Water, warm
    * 45 ml Lard
    * 10 ml Kosher Salt, fine
    * 190 g Flour, sifted

=== "Directions"
    1. **Mix starter**. Mix to combine starter ingredients. Refrigerate overnight (or at least 6 hours).
    2. **Mix dough**. Mix to combine remaining water, sugar, yeast, starter, lard, and salt. Dividing as necessary, add flour and mix until a dough ball forms.
    3. **Knead dough**. Transfer dough to a floured surface. Knead 7-10 minutes, adding flour as necessary, until a soft, slightly tacky dough forms.
    4. **Proof dough**. Transfer kneaded dough to an oiled bowl. Cover. Rest 2 hours until dough has doubled in size.
    5. **Form loaves**. Transfer proofed dough to a floured surface. Dividing into two halves, flatten and shape proofed dough into a roughly 30 cm long rectangle and roll tightly into a loaf. Flatten slightly, if desired.
    6. **Proof loaves**. Transfer loaves to a sheet pan dressed with parchment paper and semolina. Cover and proof about 2 hours until doubled in size.
    7. **Preheat oven** to 400 F (205 C).
    8. **Dress loaves**. Uncover. Slice loaves lengthwise with a knife or razorblade. Spritz with water.
    9. **Bake loaves** 25 minutes at 400 F. Remove from heat.
    10. **Rest loaves** 15 minutes.
