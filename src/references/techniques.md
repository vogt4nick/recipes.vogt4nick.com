## Oven Roasting

???+ note
    Oven roasting isn't particularly difficult, but I always, always, always forget the procedure for different meat, veg, legumes, etc. So here we are.

    Specialized recipes still get their own pages, e.g. [Roasted Potatoes](../recipes/sides/roasted-potatoes.md) and [BBRRR Chicken](../recipes/poultry/bbrrr-chicken.md)

=== "Directions"
    1. **Preheat oven** to 450 f (230 C). Dress sheet pan with aluminum foil.
    2. **Prepare**. See "specifics".
    3. **Add cooking fat**. In order of preference: Lard, ghee, extra virgin olive oil, vegetable oil. IMO less is more.
    4. **Add seasonings**. Baseline seasonings: Kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne.
    5. **Roast**. See "specifics".
