=== "Directions"
    1. **Rub beef** with salt and black pepper.
    2. **Sear beef.** Preheat oil in dutch oven over high heat. Add beef. Sear 6-7 minutes on each side to form a crust.
    3. **Make roux.** Reduce heat to low. Stir in flour until it dissolves into the remaining cooking fat. Stir in 100 ml of beef stock to deglaze dutch oven. Stir in remaining stock.
    4. **Braise pot roast.** Return seared meat to dutch oven. Add seasonings. Braise 2h 30m, covered, at a gentle simmer. Add veggies. Braise 60 minutes until meat is fork tender.
    5. **Rest beef.** Remove beef. Tent with foil. Rest 10 minutes until needed.
    6. **Reduce gravy.** Remove veggies and seasonings. Reduce stock over high heat to desired consistency. Remove from heat. Return cooked vegetables to dutch oven.
    7. **Serve.** Slice pot roast before serving. Serve with crostinis.

    !!! tip "Remember! Cold stock. Hot roux. No lumps!"

    !!! note "Starch from the vegetables will thicken the gravy."
