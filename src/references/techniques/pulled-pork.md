    1. **Brine** and cover pork in fridge for 12 hours.
    2. **Rub** dry pork shoulder with seasonings.
    3. **Smoke** pork 10-12 hours in smoker at 210 F (100 C).
    4. **Rest** 60 minutes at room temperature, tented with foil.

    ??? question "Can I substitute white sugar or kosher salt?"
        Yes, but you won't get the same result. White sugar and kosher salt do not readily dissolve into water near 0 C. Molasses and pickling salt, however, do stay dissolved into water at low temperatures.
