Our favorite chefs and food writers.

## Mark Bittman

Mark Bittman wrote our most comprehensive and most versatile cookbook, the "Big Red Book," [How to Cook Everything](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Recipes-Anniversary/dp/0764578650).

Whenever we try a new recipe, we look for Mark's stripped down, essential interpretation first. He has the rare talent to write unambiguous directions while leaving room for individual taste. In doing so, Mark really hones in on the spirit of each recipe. When I'm feeling particularly academic, I read through each chapter more thoroughly and learn something new every time.

My one complaint is that it's big; it's *too* big. It's too big to comfortably fit on a counter top, a book stand, or to carry with you into Starbucks to plan your next recipe.


## Deb Perelman

The [Smitten Kitchen blog](https://smittenkitchen.com/) and the [Smitten Kitchen Cookbook](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/030759565X/) are stupendous. Deb's recipes are constant winners and always accessible to the home cook. We have yet to make a recipe that doesn't *work*, and though some of them may challenge your skills, Deb writes in a clear way that each step is broken down to be clear and sensible.

Deb's recipes can be very involved, so plan ahead and give yourself time to spare.


## Gordon Ramsay

I'm basic, but I don't care. Gordon Ramsay's [Ultimate Cookery Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTzMGnJjrsSyDJU9XClzZtuJ6GAIsvRk7) is a wonderful series that I keep coming back to for essential dishes. He does a wonderful job of stating the obvious, but in a good way.

Gordon's recipes - even the simple ones - are difficult to get started, and that's not helped by the lack of written instructions.


## MOB Kitchen

[MOB Kitchen](http://www.mobkitchen.co.uk/) is an ideas site. Decent variety, and they share new recipes all the time. They also have a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobKitchen/). The MOB's recipes are designed with beginners in mind, so recipes usually stand out for being relatively cheap & easy.

MOB Kitchen is an ideas site, but I rarely learn something new from them. That is, MOB Kitchen gives me opportunities to apply what I've learned from other chefs.
