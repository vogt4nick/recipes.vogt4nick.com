# Nick's Recipes

I made this website because I didn't enjoy searching for recipes on my Google Drive.


## Metric Conversion Table

I use the metric system in these recipes for easier measurements. You can look up the conversions, but here are the only ones I keep on top of my head:

| Metric | Imperial |
|:--|:--|
| 5 mL | 1 Teaspoon |
| 15 mL | 1 Tablespoon |
| 30 mL | 1 Fluid Ounce |
| 240 mL | 1 Cup |
| 28 g | 1 Ounce |
| 450 g | 1 Pound |


## Measurements

For the most part I measure liquids and fine solids (e.g. flour) by volume, and solids by mass. There are some exceptions; e.g. butter is measured as volume.
