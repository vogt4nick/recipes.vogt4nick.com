These make large pasties about the size of a loaf of bread. Serve them by slicing the "loaf" like some kind of yooper beef wellington. If you prefer smaller, handheld pasties, reduce the meat mixture by half. Inspired by [Hairy Bikers' Cornish Pasties](https://www.hairybikers.com/recipes/view/cornish-pasty).

1. **Prepare kitchen.** Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Beat remaining egg in a small bowl. Set aside as *egg wash*.
2. **Prepare pasty dough.** Add flour, baking powder, butter, egg yolk, salt, water to food processor. Chop 30 seconds until mixture resembles bread crumbs. Gradually add cold water 15 mL at a time as necessary. Chop 60 seconds until mixture resembles dough. Remove dough from food processor. Roll dough into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap. Chill 10-20 minutes in freezer. Referenced later as *chilled pasty dough*.
3. **Prepare filling.** Boil salt water in stockpan. Add root vegetables. Parboil 5 minutes until tender. Drain. Rinse with cold water. Mix onion, celery, and beef. Mix evenly. Referenced later as *pasty filling*.
4. **Shape pasty.** Prepare a lightly floured surface. Transfer dough to surface. Roll dough into large, 6 mm thick disc. Add *pasty filling* in a line down the middle of the disc. Brush the edge of pasty disc with some egg wash. Draw the edges of the pasty together. Crimp and seal so that the seal sits on top of the filling. Make a small hole in the top of the pasty. Brush with remaining egg wash.
5. **Bake pasty.** Arrange pasty on greased baking tray. Bake 30 minutes at 350F until golden-brown.
