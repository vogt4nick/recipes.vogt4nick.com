## Chicken Pad Thai

It's vital that you prepare everything before cooking. Pad thai has to cook *fast*, and it can't cook fast if you're still crushing peanuts and slicing limes. Inspired by [Chez Pim](http://web.baz.org/adam/recipes/pad_thai_for_be.html).

Recipe is for one serving.

|||
|:--|:--|
| 150 mL | [Pad Thai Sauce](food-lab.md#pad-thai-sauce)
| 80 g   | Rice Sticks
| 60 mL  | Canola Oil
| 60 g   | Chicken Breast, chopped
| 5 mL   | Garlic, chopped (optional)
| 1      | Egg
| 15 g   | Peanuts, roughly ground
| 15 g   | Beansprouts
| 15 g   | Pickled Turnips, chopped (optional)
| 30 mL  | Garlic Chives*, roughly chopped
|        | Lime, sliced

*Substitute green parts of scallions for garlic chives.

1. **Warm sauce.** Simmer pad thai sauce over low heat.
2. **Soak rice sticks** in warm water until pliable, but not soft enough to eat. Remove from water and pat dry.
3. **Fry pad thai.** Heat oil in wok over high heat. Add chicken. Fry 2 minutes, tossing continuously, until halfway cooked. Add 15 mL *warm pad thai sauce* and garlic. Fry 1 minute, tossing continuously. Add *softened rice sticks* and remaining *warm pad thai sauce*. Fry 1 minute**, tossing continuously, until noodle is soft. Push food to one side of pan to add egg directly to wok surface. Fry 15 seconds. Toss together once egg starts to cook. Add the peanuts, beansprouts, and pickled turnips. Fry 1 minute, tossing continuously. Add garlic chives. Remove wok from heat. Toss.
4. **Serve** with remaining ground peanuts, paprika, fish sauce, and slivers of lime.

**If the sauce evaporates too quickly and your noodle isn't quite ready, sprinkle a bit of water and keep stirring. Add oil if the noodle still sticks together.

!!! tip
    Between batches, rinse wok with warm water and wipe away solid bits.

## Naan Bread

Garnish with your best olive oil. Inspired by [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/21cfl0/whats_the_secret_to_naan_every_recipe_ends_up/) and [Manjula's Kitchen](http://www.manjulaskitchen.com/naan-bread/).

Try baking with a rub (maybe 8 mL turmeric, 4 mL cumin, 1  mL cinnamon).

|||
|:--|:--|
| 5 mL   | Active Dry Yeast
| 5 mL   | Sugar
| 180 mL | Water, about 40C
| 250 g  | Flour, sifted
| 5 mL   | Salt
| <1 mL  | Baking Soda
| 30 mL  | Canola Oil
| 40 mL  | Yogurt, plain
| 5 mL   | Canola Oil
| 30 mL  | Garlic, minced
| 60 mL  | Extra Virgin Olive Oil

1. **Prepare yeast.** Dissolve yeast and sugar in water. Rest 10 minutes until frothy.
2. **Prepare dough.** Add flour, salt, baking soda to large bowl. Mix. Add canola oil, yogurt. Mix until crumbly. Add yeast mixture. Knead by hand into firm, smooth dough. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Rest 4 hours at 25C until dough nearly doubles in volume.
3. **Prepare oven.** Preheat pizza stone in oven to 500F (260C). Next turn the oven to high broil.
4. **Prepare garlic oil.** Heat canola oil in frying pan over medium heat. Add garlic. Cook 3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, until toasted. Transfer to small bowl. Add olive oil. Stir. Set aside as *garlic oil*.
5. **Shape naan.** Prepare a lightly floured surface. Transfer dough to floured surface. Knead dough 1 minute. Divide dough into six equal parts. Shape into ovals 5 mm thick.
6. **Bake naan.** Dampen hands. Flip the rolled naan between your palms. Place two naan loaves on pizza stone. Bake 3 minutes until brown. Allow 3 minutes between batches to reheat pizza stone.
7. **Brush naan.** Brush lightly with *garlic oil*.

!!! tip
    * Using a pizza stone will help to give the naan close to same kind of heat as a clay tandoor.
    * If pizza stone is not available, use baking sheet. If using baking sheet, turn them over to cook on the other side once the top of the naan is cooked.

## Pad Thai Sauce

Inspired by [Chez Pim](http://web.baz.org/adam/recipes/pad_thai_for_be.html).

|||
|:--|:--|
| 60 mL | Tamarind Pulp*
| 60 mL | Fish Sauce**
| 60 mL | Palm Sugar***
| 15 mL | Paprika****

*Buy pulp soaked only in water; no sugar, etc.
**Substitute soy sauce for fish sauce to make vegetarian
***Substitute 40 mL white or brown sugar for palm sugar
****Substitute a hot chili powder for spicier sauce

Add tamarind pulp, fish sauce, and sugar to small saucepan. Melt over low heat. Add paprika. Stir.

!!! tip
    Per Chez Pim, sauce should "lead with a salty flavor, follow by a mild sourness, then just a gentle sweetness and a soft caress from the chili at the back of my throat at the very end." Sweetness should be very mild.
