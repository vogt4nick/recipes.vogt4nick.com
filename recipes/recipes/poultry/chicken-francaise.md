    ??? question "How do I 'butterfly cut' chicken breast?"
        Good Housekeeping [step-by-step instructions with pictures](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/cooking/tips/g1952/butterfly-chicken-breast/).

    ??? question "Why do I have to butterfly cut the chicken breast?"
        The butterfly cut helps the chicken cook evenly. Chicken francaise is fried hot and fast. If the cut is too thick, then the chicken won't cook fully before the outside overcooks.

=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare materials.** Add flour to flat plate. Spread evenly. Referenced next as *prepared flour*. Add eggs and spices to large bowl. Whisk. Referenced next as *egg wash*. Heat olive oil in frying pan over medium-high heat. Referenced next as *hot oil*.
    2. **Fry chicken.** Coat chicken with flour. Coat chicken in egg wash. Place coated chicken in hot oil. Cook 4 minutes. Flip chicken. Cook 4 minutes until cooked through. Transfer chicken to a hot plate. Rest. Set aside as *fried chicken*. Drain remaining hot oil from frying pan.
    3. **Prepare francaise.** Pre-heat frying pan over high heat. Add ingredients in order: pinot grigio, chicken stock, garlic, lemon juice. Reduce 2 minutes over high heat. Remove from heat. Add parsley and butter. Stir evenly. Referenced next as *francaise sauce*.
    4. **Coat, garnish, and serve.** Add *fried chicken* to *francaise sauce*. Coat evenly. Garnish with remaining parsley and serve.
