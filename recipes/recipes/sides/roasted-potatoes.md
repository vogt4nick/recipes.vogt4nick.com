| 30 mL   | Salt
| 2 mL    | Baking Soda
| 900 g   | Russet Potatoes, peeled, quartered

1. **Prepare materials.** Preheat oven to 450F (230C). Prepare a foiled sheetpan.
2. **Boil potatoes.** Add potatoes, salt, baking soda, and water (enough to cover the mixture) to stockpan. Stir. Boil 6 minutes until nearly cooked-through. Strain**.
3. **Dry potatoes.** Rest potatoes 15 minutes until done steaming.
4. **Season potatoes** with spices and oil.
5. **Roast potatoes.** Move to prepared sheetpan. Spread evenly so no potatoes are touching. Roast 50 minutes at 450F, turning every 20 minutes.
6. **Serve** with sour cream for dipping.

**Do not use a fine mesh colander; the dry, starchy outsides we want to crisp will fall off the potatoes.
