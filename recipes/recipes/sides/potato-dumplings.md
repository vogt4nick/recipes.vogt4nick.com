Also called erdäpfelknödeln. Inspired by travels to Austria & Bavaria and [Bavarian Kitchen](http://www.bavariankitchen.com/sides/knoedel.aspx).


| Amount | Ingredient |
|:--|:--|
| 500 g   | Russet Potatoes, peeled
| 15 mL   | Salt
| ---     | ---
| 160 mL  | All-Purpose Flour
| 2 mL    | Salt
| 1 mL    | Nutmeg, ground (optional)
| 1       | Egg, beaten

1. **Soften potatoes.** Peel potatoes. Add potatoes, water, salt to stockpan. Bring to boil. Cook 15 minutes until tender. Remove potatoes. Reserve water in pan for later as *salt water*.
2. **Rice potatoes.** Press potatoes through ricer into a large bowl while still hot. Set aside for 30 minutes to cool, stirring occasionally.
3. **Form dumplings.** Add remaining ingredients. Mix loosely with hands. Knead the dough quickly with your hands. Form mandarin size dumplings.
4. **Cook dumplings.** Heat *salt water* to a gentle boil. Cook dumplings 8 minutes until they float to the top. Remove from water.


!!! tip
    * Dumplings need space to float in the pot that is why you need a wide pot rather than a tall pot.
    * Add additional 80 mL flour if necessary. If dough still appears too dry after adding all the flour add another beaten egg. Dough should be not too mushy but not too firm either.
