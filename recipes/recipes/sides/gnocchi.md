1. **Bake potatoes.** Preheat oven to 400F (205C). Bake potatoes at 400F for 60 minutes. Rest 60 minutes until cool.
2. **Prepare pota-dough.** Prepare a well-floured surface. Peel *baked potatoes*. Mash potatoes into large bowl. Add ricotta, egg, flour, salt, thyme. Mix. Transfer dough to well-floured surface. Knead gently.
3. **Shape dumplings.** Divide batch as necessary; roll *pota-dough* into 2 cm thick rope. Cut 3 cm dumplings from rope. [Dimple the dumplings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTmcGy9CWhE&t=175s).
4. **Cook dumplings.** Add water and olive oil to stockpan. Boil over high heat. Divide batch as necessary; add dumplings to stockpan. Note that dumplings are cooked when they begin to float.
5. **Sear dumplings.** Heat remaining olive oil frying pan over medium-high heat. Transfer *cooked dumplings* to frying pan. Add black pepper. Cook 2 minutes until brown. Flip. Cook 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
6. **Garnish and serve** with parsley.

!!! tip
    * Smitten Kitchen recommends a box grater if you don't have a potato masher, but IME this produces chunky gnocci.
    * Adding dimples to the dumplings helps them retain their shape and cook evenly while boiling.
