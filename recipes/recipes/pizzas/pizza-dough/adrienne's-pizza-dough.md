Review how to shape pizza either [Neopolitan style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITZWe_mOevw) or [New York style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNv4kmDzR9k).

Yields about three medium pizzas.

|||
|:--|:--|
| 350 g | Water, 95C
| 10 mL | Sea Salt
| 2 mL  | Instant Dry Yeast
| 500 g | 00 Flour

\* Substitute equal parts all-purpose flour for 00 flour in a pinch.

1. **Mix dough.** Add water, salt to large (>5L) dough tub. Stir until dissolved. Add yeast. Rest 60 seconds. Mix until dissolved. Add flour. Stir until dough ball forms.
2. **Knead & rest.** Cut and fold the dough a few times using [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s). Verify dough temperature is about 80F (27C). Rest 20 minutes.
3. **Knead & rise.** Transfer to a lightly-floured work surface. Knead 60 seconds until the skin of the dough is very smooth. Return dough ball seam-side down to the original, lightly-oiled dough tub. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Rest dough 2 hours between 70F - 74F (21C - 23C).
4. **Shape dough.** Dividing as necessary: Transfer dough to floured surface at least 60 cm wide. Dust top of dough with flour. Use scale to divide dough (again) into equal pieces\*. Gently shape dough pieces into medium-tight balls.
5. **Ferment dough.** Arrange dough balls on lightly flowered plate(s) with enough room to expand. Lightly flour top of dough balls. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use, no more than 48 hours.

\*e.g. 3 equal pieces for thick crust, 5 equal pieces for thin crust.
