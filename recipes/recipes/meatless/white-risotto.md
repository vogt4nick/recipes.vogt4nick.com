    You must never stop stirrig and you must be sure to wipe the bottom of the pot completely clean frequently, or the rice will stick to it.

=== "Ingredients"
    | Amount | Ingredient |
    |:--|:--|
    | 15 mL   | Butter, unsalted
    | 30 mL   | Vegetable Oil
    | 30 g    | Onion, minced
    | 400 g   | Arborio Rice, unrinsed
    | ---     | ---
    | 1200 mL | Beef Stock*, simmering
    | ---     | ---
    | 30 mL   | Butter, unsalted
    | 80 g    | Parmesan Cheese, grated
    | 15 g    | White Truffle, shaved (optional)

=== "Directions"
    1. **Parfry onion base.** Add butter, oil, and onion to a room temperature, heavy bottomed stockpan. Place over medium-high heat. Cook 8 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes, until translucent. Add rice. Coat evenly.
    2. **Cook risotto.** Maintain medium-high heat. Dividing stock into 120 mL increments: Add stock to pan and stir continuously until all the liquid is gone; continue when there is no more liquid in the pot. Gradually reduce the volume of liquid added after 20 minutes as the rice approaches a tender and firm texture.
    3. **Garnish.** Add butter and parmesan. Cook another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously. Garnish with truffles after plating.
