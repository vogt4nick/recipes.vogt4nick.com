1. **Combine.** Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Add onion, cumin, garlic. Coat evenly. Saute 8 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes. Add prepared beans, salt, remaining cumin. Stir evenly. Cook 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add rice. Stir evenly.
2. **Garnish & serve** with cilantro.

\* You can use canned beans instead, but we find the flavor & texture are better (and cheaper) starting with dry beans.
