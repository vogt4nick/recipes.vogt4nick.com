## Baguettes

There's homework before baking baguettes; watch [How to Shape Baguettes (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlN5CgQcvAg) and read [Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/classic-french-baguette-recipe-learn-how-to-make-baguettes-at-home#homemade-french-baguette-recipe). Inspired by [Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/classic-french-baguette-recipe-learn-how-to-make-baguettes-at-home#homemade-french-baguette-recipe) and [King Arther Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/classic-baguettes-recipe).

|||
|:--|:--|
| 100 g  | Bread Flour*, unbleached
| 1 mL   | Instant Yeast
| 100 mL | Water, warm (35C)
| 7 mL   | Salt
| 4 mL   | Instant Yeast
| 425 g  | Bread Flour*, unbleached
| 240 mL | Water, warm (35C)
| 30 mL  | Semolina Flour
| 240 mL | Water, hot (80C)

*Substitute all-purpose flour for bread flour

1. **Prepare poolish.** Add flour, yeast, and water to medium bowl. Mix. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Rest 6-24 hours at room temperature until poolish is expanded and bubbly.
2. **Prepare dough.** Transfer 240 mL *poolish* to large bowl. Add salt, yeast, flour, water. Gently stir 2 minutes with spoon until a soft (but not sticky) dough ball forms. Knead 6 minutes with dough hook at medium speed until dough passes the windowpane test.
3. **Rise dough.** Lightly grease a large bowl. Transfer dough greased bowl. Roll dough to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Rest 2 hours at 25C until the dough nearly doubles in size. Remove dough. Gently knead 1 minute by hand. Return dough to bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Rest 2 hours at 25C until the dough nearly doubles in size.
4. **Shape loaves.** Prepare a lightly floured surface. Transfer dough to prepared surface. Divide dough into thirds using a bench scraper (careful not to deflate air bubbles). [Shape each baguette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlN5CgQcvAg) into a 10 cm diameter baguette.
5. **Proof loaves.** Prepare a floured kitchen towel. Transfer loaves to towel. Scrunch towel between loaves to help shape loaves as they proof. Proof 50 minutes at 25C until the loaves have grown to one-and-a-half times their original size but still spring back when poked.
6. **Prepare oven.** Place one oven rack in the lowest position and one in the middle position. Place an empty sheet pan in the bottom rack; we'll use this pan to produce steam later. Preheat oven to 500F (260C).
7. **Score loaves.** With the seam side down, score loaf using a bread lame or razor blade. Cut 3 evenly spaced diagonal slashes 6 mm deep on the surface of the loaf.
8. **Bake loaves.** Add layer of semolina flour to new sheet pan. Transfer loaves to sheet pan. Place sheet pan in oven on middle rack. Pour hot water into the empty loaf pan on the bottom rack. Set oven to 450F (235C) (evaporating water will quickly cool oven from 500F to 450F). Bake 10 minutes. Rotate middle sheet pan. Bake 8 minutes until internal temperature of baguettes are 205F (95C).
9. **Cool baguettes.** Transfer baguettes to cooling rack. Rest 40 minutes at room temperature.


!!! tip
    * From [Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/classic-french-baguette-recipe-learn-how-to-make-baguettes-at-home)
    > The 'windowpane test' is a way to check the gluten development of your dough during kneading. Break off a small piece of dough, and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough to see through. If you can indeed see through it, you’re done kneading. If the dough breaks before you can stretch it out that thin, keep kneading.
    * Baking during cooler seasons is a challenge; the dough won't rise if the kitchen is too cold (e.g. 20C). Vent the oven at 350F (175C) while dough is rising and proofing to warm kitchen to 25C.

## Gnocchi

Inspired by the [Smitten Kitchen Cookbook](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/030759565X/) and [Gordon Ramsay (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTmcGy9CWhE&t=19s).

| 15 mL   | Olive Oil
| 5 mL    | Black Pepper
| 5 mL    | Parsley, dried, ground


1. **Bake potatoes.** Preheat oven to 400F (205C). Bake potatoes at 400F for 60 minutes. Rest 60 minutes until cool.
2. **Prepare pota-dough.** Prepare a well-floured surface. Peel *baked potatoes*. Mash potatoes into large bowl. Add ricotta, salt, flour, egg, thyme. Mix. Transfer dough to well-floured surface. Knead gently.
3. **Shape dumplings.** Divide batch as necessary; roll *pota-dough* into 2 cm thick rope. Cut 3 cm dumplings from rope. [Dimple the dumplings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTmcGy9CWhE&t=175s).
4. **Cook dumplings.** Add water and olive oil to stockpan. Boil over high heat. Divide batch as necessary; add dumplings to stockpan. Note that dumplings are cooked when they begin to float.
5. **Sear dumplings.** Heat remaining olive oil frying pan over medium-high heat. Transfer *cooked dumplings* to frying pan. Add black pepper. Cook 2 minutes until brown. Flip. Cook 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
6. **Garnish and serve** with parsley.

!!! tip
    * Smitten Kitchen recommends a box grater if you don't have a potato masher, but IME this produces chunky gnocci.
    * Adding dimples to the dumplings helps them retain their shape and cook evenly while boiling.

## Potato Dumplings

Also called erdäpfelknödeln. Inspired by travels to Austria & Bavaria and [Bavarian Kitchen](http://www.bavariankitchen.com/sides/knoedel.aspx).


|||
|:--|:--|
| 1000 mL | Water, cold
| 15 mL   | Salt
| 500 g   | Russet Potatoes, peeled
| 160 mL  | All-Purpose Flour
| 2 mL    | Salt
| 1 mL    | Nutmeg, ground (optional)
| 1       | Egg, beaten

1. **Soften potatoes.** Peel potatoes. Add potatoes, water, salt to stockpan. Bring to boil. Cook 15 minutes until tender. Remove potatoes. Reserve water in pan for later as *salt water*.
2. **Rice potatoes.** Press potatoes through ricer into a large bowl while still hot. Set aside for 30 minutes to cool, stirring occasionally.
3. **Form dumplings.** Add remaining ingredients. Mix loosely with hands. Knead the dough quickly with your hands. Form mandarin size dumplings.
4. **Cook dumplings.** Heat *salt water* to a gentle boil. Cook dumplings 8 minutes until they float to the top. Remove from water.


!!! tip
    * Dumplings need space to float in the pot that is why you need a wide pot rather than a tall pot.
    * Add additional 80 mL flour if necessary. If dough still appears too dry after adding all the flour add another beaten egg. Dough should be not too mushy but not too firm either.

## Tahini

This recipe really only pays if you pick up quality ingredients. Pick up a small jar of quality sesame seeds and mix 4:1 with your best olive oil.

|||
|:--|:--|
| 60 mL | Sesame Seeds
| 15 mL | Extra Virgin Olive Oil

1. **Prepare materials.** Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Prepare a sheetpan dressed with parchment paper.
2. **Toast sesame seeds.** Add sesame seeds to sheetpan. Spread evenly. Toast 12 minutes, tossing halfway through.

4. **Puree tahini paste.** Combine sesame powder and olive oil. Whisk well.

!!! tip
    I understand can pulverize and puree the paste at the same time with a food processor. In my experience, sesame seeds are too small for this, and you end up with a chunky tahini paste.
