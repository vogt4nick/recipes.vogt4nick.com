Simmer gently until all water has evaporated and artichokes are lightly browned and fork tender. Remove from heat. Combine with bechamel sauce. Set aside as *creamy artichoke hearts*.
3. **Grease dish** with butter and bechamel sauce.
4. **Layer lasagna.** Build 6+ layers of pasta, creamy artichoke hearts, and parmesan. Top with remaining bechamel sauce. Dot with butter. Garnish with remaining parmesan.
5. **Bake** 12 minutes until a light, golden crust forms on top. Remove from oven.
6. **Cool** 10 minutes at room temperature.
7. **Serve** with grated parmesan.

!!! bug "I don't see a crust forming"
    If after the first few minutes you don't see any sign of a crust beginning to form, increase the oven temperature to 450F (220C). Bake no longer than 15 minutes altogether.
