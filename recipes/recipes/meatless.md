| 30 mL   | Kosher Salt
| ---     | ---

| 80 mL   | Heavy Cream
| 30 g    | Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
| 1 mL    | Kosher Salt
| 1 mL    | Black Pepper

1. **Mix Pasta Dough.** Add flour, salt to food processor. Pulse briefly. Add eggs. Pulse briefly. Incrementally add water until a firm - but not sticky - dough ball forms. Process dough 15 seconds.
2. **Rest Dough.** Transfer dough to a floured surface. Cover with an inverted bowl. Rest 1 hour. Clean food processor for next steps.
3. **Saute Veggies.** Melt butter in skillet over medium-high heat, until foam subsides. Add onion. Saute 6 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes. Add artichoke hearts. Saute 8 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. **Puree Filling.** Transfer artichoke mixture to food processor, but reserve 200 mL of mixture in skillet for next steps. Add cheese, parsley, yolk, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and nutmeg and pulse until mixture is coarsely chopped.
5. **Prepare Egg Wash.** Combine egg white and water in small bowl. Referenced later as egg wash.
6. **Preheat oven** to 350F (175C).
7. **Flatten Pasta Dough.** Dividing into 4 batches, flatten pasta dough into a rectangle. Cover rectangles with an inverted large bowl. Set pasta machine rollers on widest setting.
8. **Roll Pasta.** Dividing into four batches: Lightly dust 1 rectangle with flour and feed through pasta rollers. Fold rectangle in half. Folded end first, feed rectangle through rollers. Repeat 8 times, dusting with flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Turn dial to next (narrower) setting. Feed dough through rollers without folding. Repeat until rollers reach narrowest setting.* (Resulting dough sheet should be approximately 10 cm x 60 cm.)
9. **Form Ravioli.** Line a large shallow baking pan with a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and dust towel with flour. Dividing as necessary: Place dough sheets on on a floured surface. Down the center of one half of sheet, add six 8 mL mounds of filling 5 cm apart. Brush egg wash around each mound. Fold sheet in half, covering other half of sheet over filling. Press down firmly around each mound, forcing out air.** Between mounds, cut pasta into 3-inch circles. Transfer ravioli to prepared towel.
10. **Boil Ravioli.** Add water and salt to stock pan. Heat to gentle boil. Add ravioli. Stir to separate. Boil 6 minutes, adjusting heat to keep water at a gentle boil. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a colander.
11. **Reheat Artichoke Mixture.** Reheat reserved artichoke mixture in skillet over moderately high heat. Add tomatoes, water. Cook 5 minutes, stirring continuously, until tomatoes are softened.
12. **Dress Ravioli.** Transfer half of ravioli to baking dish. Top ravioli with artichoke mixture, cream, cheese. Sprinkle with salt, pepper.
13. **Bake Ravioli.** Bake 15 minutes at 350F until heated through and cream is bubbling.

\*Dough will be a smooth sheet (about 24 inches long and 4 inches wide).

\*\*Air pockets increase the chance that ravioli will break during cooking.
