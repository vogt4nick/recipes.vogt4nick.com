## Hollandaise Sauce (V)

A few alterations to Julia Child's recipe in [Mastering the Art of French Cooking](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Art-French-Cooking-Vol/dp/0375413405).

|||
|:--|:--|
| 10 mL  | Lemon Juice
| 20 mL  | Water, cold
| 1 mL   | Kosher Salt
| ---    | ---
| 3      | Egg Yolks
|        | *Lemon-Water-Salt Mixture*
| ---    | ---
| 15 mL  | Butter, cold
| ---    | ---
| 15 mL  | Butter, cold
| ---    | ---
| 120 mL | Butter, unsalted, melted

1. **Simmer water** in stockpot. Maintain at a bare simmer.
2. **Mix water, lemon juice, salt** and set aside.
3. **Whisk egg yolks.** Add egg yolks to a room temperature pyrex bowl. Transfer bowl to stockpot to form a makeshift double boiler. Whisk eggs 60 seconds over double boiler. Add *lemon-water-salt mixture*. Whisk 30 seconds over double boiler.
4. **Thicken sauce.** Add cold butter. Whisk 1-2 minutes over double boiler until mixture is 160F (70C).*
5. **Cool sauce.** Remove bowl from heat. Add remaining cold butter. Whisk 60 seconds.
6. **Thickening sauce more.** While whisking sauce, slowly drip melted butter until the sauce begins to thicken into a heavy cream. Omit the milky residue at the bottom of the butter pan.

*If you have no thermometer then, per Julia, whisk until "you can begin to see the bottom of the bowl between strokes and the mixture forms a light cream on the wires of the whisk... If it seems to be thickening too quickly, or even suggest a lumpy quality, immediately plunge the bottom of the pan in cold water, beating the yolks to cool them."

Add boiling water to prevent curdling.

## Tahini Paste (V+)

This recipe really only pays if you pick up quality ingredients. Pick up a small jar of quality sesame seeds and mix 4:1 with your best olive oil.

|||
|:--|:--|
| 60 mL | Sesame Seeds
| 15 mL | Extra Virgin Olive Oil

1. **Prepare materials.** Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Prepare a sheetpan dressed with parchment paper.
2. **Toast sesame seeds.** Add sesame seeds to sheetpan. Spread evenly. Toast 12 minutes, tossing halfway through.
3. **Pulverize sesame seeds.** Dividing as necessary, pulverize toasted sesame seeds into a powder with a mortar & pestle.
4. **Puree tahini paste.** Combine sesame powder and olive oil. Whisk well.

!!! tip
    One can pulverize and puree the paste at the same time with a food processor. In my experience, sesame seeds are too small for this, and you end up with a chunky tahini paste.

## Pad Thai Sauce (/V+)

Inspired by [Chez Pim](http://web.baz.org/adam/recipes/pad_thai_for_be.html).

|||
|:--|:--|
| 60 mL | Tamarind Pulp*
| 60 mL | Fish Sauce**
| 60 mL | Palm Sugar***
| 15 mL | Paprika****

*Buy pulp soaked only in water; no sugar, etc.
**Substitute soy sauce for fish sauce to make vegetarian
***Substitute 40 mL white or brown sugar for palm sugar
****Substitute a hot chili powder for spicier sauce

Add tamarind pulp, fish sauce, and sugar to small saucepan. Melt over low heat. Add paprika. Stir.

!!! tip
    Per Chez Pim, sauce should "lead with a salty flavor, follow by a mild sourness, then just a gentle sweetness and a soft caress from the chili at the back of my throat at the very end." Sweetness should be very mild.
