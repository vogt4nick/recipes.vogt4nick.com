1. **Marinate beef.** Add steak strips to large ziplock bag. Add sauces and spices. Coat evenly. Marinate 8 hours in refrigerator.
2. **Dehydrate beef.** Add marinated steak strips to dehydrator. Dehydrate 5 hours at 160F (70C). Store in an airtight container or resealable bags.

!!! tip
    Substitute 30 mL pineapple juice for meat tenderizer in a pinch. Ultimately, we're introducing enzymes to break down the meat fibers. Pineapple juice does this just as well.
