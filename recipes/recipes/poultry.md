## Chicken Pad Thai (/V)

It's vital that you prepare everything before cooking. Pad thai has to cook *fast*, and it can't cook fast if you're still crushing peanuts and slicing limes. Inspired by [Chez Pim](http://web.baz.org/adam/recipes/pad_thai_for_be.html).

Recipe is for one serving.

|||
|:--|:--|
| 150 mL | [Pad Thai Sauce](sauces.md#pad-thai-sauce)
| 80 g   | Rice Sticks
| 60 mL  | Canola Oil
| 60 g   | Chicken Breast, chopped
| 5 mL   | Garlic, chopped (optional)
| 1      | Egg
| 15 g   | Peanuts, roughly ground
| 15 g   | Beansprouts
| 15 g   | Pickled Turnips, chopped (optional)
| 30 mL  | Garlic Chives*, roughly chopped
|        | Lime, sliced

*Substitute green parts of scallions for garlic chives.

1. **Warm sauce.** Simmer pad thai sauce over low heat.
2. **Soak rice sticks** in warm water until pliable, but not soft enough to eat. Remove from water and pat dry.
3. **Fry pad thai.** Heat oil in wok over high heat. Add chicken. Fry 2 minutes, tossing continuously, until halfway cooked. Add 15 mL *warm pad thai sauce* and garlic. Fry 1 minute, tossing continuously. Add *softened rice sticks* and remaining *warm pad thai sauce*. Fry 1 minute**, tossing continuously, until noodle is soft. Push food to one side of pan to add egg directly to wok surface. Fry 15 seconds. Toss together once egg starts to cook. Add the peanuts, beansprouts, and pickled turnips. Fry 1 minute, tossing continuously. Add garlic chives. Remove wok from heat. Toss.
4. **Serve** with remaining ground peanuts, paprika, fish sauce, and slivers of lime.

**If the sauce evaporates too quickly and your noodle isn't quite ready, sprinkle a bit of water and keep stirring. Add oil if the noodle still sticks together.

!!! tip
    Between batches, rinse wok with warm water and wipe away solid bits.
