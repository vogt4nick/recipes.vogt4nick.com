# Bean Salad (V+)

A flexible recipe that works for for all legumes; i.e. beans, lentils, split peas. Inspired by [How to Cook Everything](https://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Recipes-Anniversary/dp/0764578650).

Note that cooked legumes yield about 2x-3x their dry weight. Here's a [chart](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/is-there-a-ratio-for-converting-between-dried.html) for some beans.

Yields about 800 g.

| 300 g | Legumes, dry
| ---   | ---
| 25 g  | Red Onion or Shallots
| 15 mL | Red Wine Vinegar or Lemon Juice
| 50 g  | Extra Virgin Olive Oil
|       | Kosher Salt
|       | Black Pepper
|       | *Hot Legumes*
| ---   | ---
| 25 g  | Parsley, fresh

1. **Soak & undercook legumes.** Prepare legumes accordingly, undercooking so they are barely tender inside and their skins remain intact. Drain. Keep warm, and set aside as *hot legumes*.
2. **Combine.** Add onion, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper to large bowl. Stir to combine. Add *hot legumes*. Toss gently.
3. **Cool** to room temperature, gently stirring every 20 minutes.
