=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare poolish.** Add flour, yeast, and water to medium bowl. Mix. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Rest 6-24 hours at room temperature until poolish is expanded and bubbly.
    2. **Prepare dough.** Transfer 240 mL *poolish* to large bowl. Add salt, yeast, flour, water. Gently stir 2 minutes with spoon until a soft (but not sticky) dough ball forms. Knead 6 minutes with dough hook at medium speed until dough passes the windowpane test.
    3. **Rise dough.** Lightly grease a large bowl. Transfer dough greased bowl. Roll dough to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Rest 2 hours at 25C until the dough nearly doubles in size. Remove dough. Gently knead 1 minute by hand. Return dough to bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Rest 2 hours at 25C until the dough nearly doubles in size.
    4. **Shape loaves.** Prepare a lightly floured surface. Transfer dough to prepared surface. Divide dough into thirds using a bench scraper (careful not to deflate air bubbles). [Shape each baguette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlN5CgQcvAg) into a 10 cm diameter baguette.
    5. **Proof loaves.** Prepare a floured kitchen towel. Transfer loaves to towel. Scrunch towel between loaves to help shape loaves as they proof. Proof 50 minutes at 25C until the loaves have grown to 1.5x times their original size but still spring back when poked.
    6. **Prepare oven.** Place one oven rack in the lowest position and one in the middle position. Place an empty sheet pan in the bottom rack; we'll use this pan to produce steam later. Preheat oven to 500F (260C).
    7. **Score loaves.** With the seam side down, score loaf using a bread lame or razor blade. Cut 3 evenly spaced diagonal slashes 6 mm deep on the surface of the loaf.
    8. **Bake loaves.** Add layer of semolina flour to new sheet pan. Transfer loaves to sheet pan. Place sheet pan in oven on middle rack. Pour hot water into the empty loaf pan on the bottom rack. Set oven to 450F (235C) (evaporating water will quickly cool oven from 500F to 450F). Bake 10 minutes. Rotate middle sheet pan. Bake 8 minutes until internal temperature of baguettes are 205F (95C).
    9. **Cool baguettes.** Transfer baguettes to cooling rack. Rest 40 minutes at room temperature.


??? question "What's the 'windowpane test'?"
    * From [Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/classic-french-baguette-recipe-learn-how-to-make-baguettes-at-home)
    > The 'windowpane test' is a way to check the gluten development of your dough during kneading. Break off a small piece of dough, and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough to see through. If you can indeed see through it, you’re done kneading. If the dough breaks before you can stretch it out that thin, keep kneading.

??? tip "Proof someplace warm"
    Baking during cooler seasons is a challenge; the dough won't rise if the kitchen is too cold (e.g. 20C). Vent the oven at 350F (175C) while dough is rising and proofing to warm kitchen to 25C.
