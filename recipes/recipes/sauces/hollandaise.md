=== "Directions"
    1. **Simmer water** in stockpot. Maintain at a bare simmer.
    2. **Mix water, lemon juice, salt** and set aside.
    3. **Whisk egg yolks.** Add egg yolks to a room temperature pyrex bowl. Transfer bowl to stockpot to form a makeshift double boiler. Whisk eggs 60 seconds over double boiler. Add *lemon-water-salt mixture*. Whisk 30 seconds over double boiler.
    4. **Thicken sauce.** Add cold butter. Whisk 1-2 minutes over double boiler until mixture is 160F (70C).*
    5. **Cool sauce.** Remove bowl from heat. Add remaining cold butter. Whisk 60 seconds.
    6. **Thickening sauce more.** While whisking sauce, slowly drip melted butter until the sauce begins to thicken into a heavy cream. Omit the milky residue at the bottom of the butter pan.

    ??? question "I have no thermometer. How do I know its 160F?
        Per Julia, whisk until "you can begin to see the bottom of the bowl between strokes and the mixture forms a light cream on the wires of the whisk... If it seems to be thickening too quickly, or even suggest a lumpy quality, immediately plunge the bottom of the pan in cold water, beating the yolks to cool them."
