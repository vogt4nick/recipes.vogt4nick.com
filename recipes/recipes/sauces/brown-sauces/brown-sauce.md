## Brown Sauce

A flour-based brown sauce which, per Julia, is "the one most nearly approaching the traditional *demi-glace*."

Inspired with few changes by Julia Child's recipe in [Mastering the Art of French Cooking](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Art-French-Cooking-Vol/dp/0375413405).

Yields about 1000 mL.
