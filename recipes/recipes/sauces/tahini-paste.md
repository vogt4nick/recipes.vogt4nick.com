    | 60 ml | Sesame Seeds
    | 15 ml | Extra Virgin Olive Oil

=== "Directions"
    1. **Prepare materials.** Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Prepare a sheetpan dressed with parchment paper.
    2. **Toast sesame seeds.** Add sesame seeds to sheetpan. Spread evenly. Toast 12 minutes, tossing halfway through.
    3. **Pulverize sesame seeds.** Dividing as necessary, pulverize toasted sesame seeds into a powder with a mortar & pestle.
    4. **Puree tahini paste.** Combine sesame powder and olive oil. Whisk well.

    ??? question "I don't have a mortar & pestle. How do I pulverize the sesame seeds?"
        One can pulverize and puree the paste at the same time with a food processor; however, IME sesame seeds are too small for this, and you end up with a chunky tahini paste.


!!! tip "This recipe really only exceeds store-bought tahini if you pick up quality ingredients."
