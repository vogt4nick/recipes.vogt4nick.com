I made this website because I didn't enjoy searching for recipes on my Google Drive.

Today it's something of a personal notebook. As such, it's primarily for my own purposes and my own easy access. If you, the wayward viewer, decides they want to try a recipe, then you'll have to adapt the recipe on your own.
